I fully agree to that statement because of the following reasons . First , an already successful person will accept a higher risk because he has a larger security if he fails . When the new thing produces loss he still has the gains of the successful working actions he did before . So he has a lower risk than a person who could lose everything by experimenting with new things .  Secondly , the hunger for success grows with the success one has . A successful person knows there has to be more than the already achieved . The known old patterns will only provide the known old amount of success . But to increase it there have to be found new unknown and maybe also unfamiliar kinds of ways which mostly have a higher risk but also a higher possible gain than the conventional ones . If someone has a risky character he will not stop at the first success but look for more the whole life .  The third and i think most important argument deals with experience with fear of the future . If a person were successful at least once in his or her life by taking a risk he or she has made an important step . By crossing the border in one 's own mind once the next time it will be easier because you get a kind of imagination what ist waiting for you on the other side . Of course there is no possible calculation with all risks , there will always be some one did not think about . Despite of that the person knows how to deal with developments that can not be foreseen , so he or she has no or at least less fear of them .  Thes arguments show , why success on a high level is not possible without risks at a high level and therefore i agree with the given statement .	GER
In today 's world it is an undeniable fact that having broad knowladge of many academic subjects has a crucial importance because people are in need of various informations about many subjects . Today being professional in one subject is not enough to be succesfull and to compete with other competitors . Perhaps you can do your job perfectly but there are many people who want to have that job . Therefore you should be more different and effective than the others and this is possible just having broad knowladge about various academic subjects .  To begin with , it is a clear fact that world is so crowded and people have to compete to have good living conditions . While their academic education procces is continuing they should try to develop themselves in different fields because to be specialized in one subject is not enough to pass other competitors . For this reason if they want to be succesful they should take into consideration this difficulty .  In addition to this , people live in an competing world and if they want to be in high class or if they want to have good living conditions they have to be powerful and of course they should have to enough equipments to fight and compete the other people . Namely the most important weapon in this competition is having broad knowledge in today 's world .  All things considered the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that the world and age has significantly changed . Although real weapons such as guns were the most powerful equipments to compete with other countries and people in various fields in the past . Now people are in need of different things such as inteligance , ability and of course wide knowledge to show their difference from the other peoples . Competition is difficult person who has broad knowledge , is intelligant and powerful will win the praise of people and life .	TUR
I disagree that the trip which is led by a tour guide in a group is a best way to travel .  Surely , if we travel with a tour gude , we can enjoy a trip even if we can not speal english well because if we have a problem , a tour guide will help us to solve the problem . In addition , we can go to famous place in a good way . It means that we can go many place without waste time . At the same time , we will be able to get a lot of knowledges about the place which we go from a tour guide . If we travel with tour guide , we will enjoy and we will be safe .  However , if we travel with a tour guide in a group , we have to mind time anytime . If we have free time , we have to come back on time which a tour giude says . If we want to look more , we can not do that if we travel with a tour guide . If we have a place which we want to go , we can not go there if the place is not the place of course even if the place is very near the way of course . If we travel by ourselves , we do n't need mind time . we can stay the place as we want . Furthermore , we can make a plan the travel as we want . Therefore , we do n't need got to the place which we are not interested in and we can go to the place only we are interested in .  In my opinion , planning the trip is one of the enjoyments of trip . If we make a plan from first to finish , we may have some ploblem . However , if the trip is finish , we can get a lot of happiness . Therefore , Idisagree	JPN
I agree with this statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . Successful people are those who keep on doing experiments to make existing things less complicated and they are the ones who develop new things . For example in earlyman 's time people used to do travelling by carts . But nowadays we are able to travel overseas . We use cars , aeroplanes , helicopters . If man had n't tried new things or man had n't used his innovative mind , he would n't been able to design new and fastest ways of transportation .  Moreover for success taking risk and doing new things is necessary . For example in my family my mother is a house wife , my grandmother was also a housewife . But I want to be a scientist , so I am going against our conventional rules and regulations . I am trying new things which in our family nobody has tried like I am planning to go abroad to get a doctoral degree as my country is a develoding one . So , I personally believe in the above statement .  We should always try new things and should give innovative things to this world . Making new technologies by taking risk is they key to success . For example If nobody had tried going to moon , we wont be able to explore and know how does moon looks and what are the properties of moon .  But sometimes trying new things can be dangerous too . For example `` Kalpana chawla '' famous astronaut of NASA , died when her spacecraft was coming back to the earth after doing some valuable discoveries .  But in the long run `` Success goes to those people who keep on trying new things instead of sticking to old things '' .	HIN
Well its a kind of statement that can be made just to encourage kids to learn more and new things in their life . But as the saying goes that `` All that glitters is not gold '' the same can be applied to successful people as well . The fundamental cause of this problem is not in the people we talk about , but its within us . It is because we always measure a successful person only when his / her work achieves more recognition / fame and or money and that he/she is really worth something which most of us are not . Thus its very hard to judge and measure success in terms of money or fame or recognition , as for him its just a task he wanted to accomplish for himself .  Lets consider a sport say soccer . We know that some of the players do play very well compared to rest of the players of that game , but in reality they only play those games which they practiced for years without having to gain success in other games . The very same way we can not just say the founder of microsoft has been a very successful person as he did not do any thing apart from being in the business of providing software for computers . I wonder how much of knowledge or expertise he would have in the area of mining , the same would be the case in the designer ware and clothing segment of business . Interestingly there was an argument that walmart or the other chain stores should be considered successful people . I would opine against the people as well in terms of success as what they had been doing is that of selling .  I definitely would have said some peron successful if he would have achieved a good name and money in the area of selling , also gaining the same momentum in other areas such as manufacturing and in research . Thus I would rather say that some people remain successful even when they try new things .	TEL
Yes , I agree with the statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  The Homo sapiens can be broadly classifed into two categories .  The first category consist of those people who are happy to live a risk-free normal life . They like to get up in the morning , do the house chores and leave for the office , sit in a cubicle and spend 8 hours 5 days a week . They want to enjoy the weekend with the family and LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER . The main charaterstic of this category is that they want to live their life exactly in the same manner as their neighbour is living . The only example that comes to my mind for this category is the COMMON MAN . This is what differentiates them from the other category of Homo sapiens . They make a contribution to the society as a WHOLE but their individual contribution is minimal . They will not be remembered because of the fact that they do what they are told to do .  The second category of Homo sapiens are those who actually make the world a better place to live in . People in this category have the names like Albert Einstein , Thomas Edison , Mahatma Gandhi , Yuri Gagarin , and many others . What makes them special is the fact that they all were curious and excited to explore new areas in their field . Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison made a breakthrough in science , gave us gravtiy and elctricity respectively . Mahatma Gandhi created ripples in the political world through his approach of non-violence movements . Because Yuri Gagrin dared to enter into space , that we were able to think beyond the planet Earth . These people had some characterstics similar at root levels . They were ready to work in a monotonous environment . They were ready to risk anything to prove their point .	HIN

It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic rather than to specialize in one specific subject , as gain of knowledge depends on the exchange of information . Innovation of new things is done by having broad knowledge of subjects in many academic subjects .  An wide view of an individual in the knowledge can achieve his or her goals towards his or her sucess . Having an broadknowledge in academic subjects not only makes perfect person but also increases confidence in him which is very much essential in growth of the person .  Broad knowledge of many subjects makes the person to get focus on the changing trends of technology , change in technology which requires the innovative thinking and smartness and talent and wide range of information to make the company to progress and flourish in the future .  For example an company which is under devolping requires an efficent and effective people to bring the fame to the company , so the company depends on sort of person who could bring an all round change in its performance . Company hires an person who is well established an known about the all aspects of marketing and bussiness . The company needs a lot of commitment and dedication , at the sametime he must be smart enough to scope with the situation and understand the needs of company and anlaylse the problem with broad knowledge and give an correct solution so that it its sectors are established in fullfledged .  In the downfall the company he must be able to think the main reason for its downfall by actually knowing which sector has to be improvised and perfect soloution should be given which solves it instantly .  Increase in the future trends and demands of the society , an thorough knowledge on academic subjects makes an person an conceptual and makes him more pratical in real time situation . Rather than specialization in one subject its more important to focus on whole . knowledge is divided and partitioned in various subects , so understand the whole knowledge of an academic its important to be perfect all the subjects	TEL
I do not agree with this statement . In my opinion it is not possible to do such a statement and to make clear what I mean , I 'm going to explain my point of view with some examples .  Befor I started studying medicin I worked as a Rettungsassistentin . I met a few pepole , old and young ones and I often had the time to talk with them for a while . Everyone had his own live-story and many of them really liked to tell me about their positions to live and their experience . Now I would like to describe two really sicnificant conversations I had .  The first conversation I had was with an older woman . She was about 80 years old and lived in a pension for olds . She was very sick but always with a smile on her month . We met a several times and we always talk a lot . She told me great stories about her and her husband Karl who died 2 years ago . All the time she felt absolutely fine with herself and the world around and that ' s why I asked her one day what her miracle is like . She laught and answered me > Young lady , do not belief that I do not know how crule life can be , I have seen it . But this is the reason why I am so lucky . I thank good for what I have and I enjoy everyday in my life . It is a question of position . > The other situation I would like to describe was with a girl in my age . She wanted to kill herself becaus her boyfriend left her two days ago and she thougt life would be over know . For her there were no more sense in life .  I think this statement made at the beginning is not right . It is important to look individually at everyone ! It is a question of view !	GER
Nowadays , a product is for 80 % sold thank to the marketing department . This implies that the marketers have to prove and to show ourselves that the product they sell is the best on a certain market . It seems that everybody from the twentieth century must be aware of the great impact that the enterprises have on our shopping .  It is totally right that the firm will try to transmit a message through its product in order to reach our desires and our needs . They put their whole ressources in the communication , everything leans on it .  Knowing this , the customers should be able to distinguish the reality from the dream . The enterprises use the naivity and the innocence of some people a lot . In consequence , this is our role as consumers to know that an advertisment does not reflect the real qualities of a product . Everything is based on the image the firm wants to show .  For example , a toy for kids will always seem better than it really is . Mostly because the children will want to see it like that and to be attracted to it . It is exactly the same thing for a target market like the aged persons . The entire society is conditionned to be - or at least to seem - perfect and beautiful until no age . The enterprises know that and use this influence a lot to sell their product .  As a conclusion , it is hard to define either advertisements are more or less representative of the reality . It is sure though , that the objective of an enterprise is to make the consumers believe that their product will give them beauty , health or anything they are trying to find . Moreover , it depends on the personnality of the buyers because they wo n't have to buy the product . They will take the final decision . In other words , it is up to us , consumers .	FRE
Today , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . I agree partly with the previous statement . The first point , I wuold like to make is that the young people nowadays are very busy with own engangement , that do not have enough spare time . I think , that this is the main motive because young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .  As regards me , I am a student at University , I do not ever have time spare . I am always busy to work to university . Many time I do not have time to see my boyfriend and my friend , also I have feel to to helping my communities , I do not have time to make it .  Therefore , last years I suceed to organize a big party , in my country , to gather money to helping the poor childern . In addiction , sometimes I helping the children of my country to make homework .  These events seldom happen , because I do not enough spare time . My situation is similar with the situation of my friends . In conclusion , I think that today , yuong people do not give enough time to helping their communities . In addition , I think that the main reason of this type of bahavior is that yuong people do not have enough time .	ITA
I disagree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because I know a lot of young people do help their communities .  I have friends who are engaged in the group of comedians . They are all from 20 to around 30 years old . Whereas they perform at theaters to make money , they also perform for children and elderly people at daycare centers . They says that they just really like to see the audiences laughing .  I know a group which is called `` Guardian Angels . '' The group is consisted of about 50 young people . The members of the group patroll around downtown and if they find someone who needs help , they help or advise him/her . For example , when they find girls who are under 18 or younger after midnight in the street , they convinced them to go home earlier .  Another example is that a young woman help her community develop their sight-seeing industry . She works at a travel agency in her small town . Because she wanted to make her town well-known , she decided to appeal her town . She planned to have a festival and carried it out . People in the town cooperated with her and brought a lot of food , crafts and suvenirs to the festival . As a result , a lot of people came to visit her town and the town has improved their sight-seeing industry .  Thus , a lot of young people are assosiated with their communities and contribute to them . They simply enjoy helping their communities .	JPN
Although most advertisement companies states insistantly that they are deeply considering the ethical issues in advertisements , I think most of the advertisements produced by these companies are exaggrated . Firstly , these companies are taking high amounts of money from customers and as a result they want to appreciate these customers . Rather than using creativity in preparation process , they just exaggrate the properties of the products . After all these deceptions , the products can be perceived much more valuable by the public . In order to avoid these type of misleading advertisements , there should be an effective control mechanism like a properly working group which investigates the advertisements before they are published . A second solution might be strict regulations like fining the misleading companies etc .  Secondly , these advertisements only emphasizes the positive attributes of the product but gives no information about its drawbacks . In this way , people who buy the product , do not the weak points of the products . For instance , a product which can clean only smooth surfaces might be used by the owner on rough surface which will probably cause deformation to the product . Here , it can be stated that this problem is caused by the advertisement which did not include the constraints of the product .  Finally , there is a great competition between the products of different companies which causes the omittion of some ethical values . Rather than stating the drawbacks , praising is a common style in the advertisements .  To conclude , the advertisements are misleading in most ways and these faults must be corrected by means of proper control mechanism . Furthermore we should know that frankness is the most important virtue on the earth .	TUR
Does young people enjoy life more than older people do ? If I am asked to answer this question , I would say no . Many older people think and say that young people have freedom and they can do whatever they want . However , that is not true for young people because there are many things to do for young people befor they become an adult .  As a young person , I feel like I have very limited life . Teens go to school everyday , they have to do their homeworks and projects , and they also have to prepare to go to college . Preparing for the college gives a lot of stress to young people because most of the students want to go to good colleges . In order to go to good college , they need to work hard in school and also they need to do many extracurricular activities . Even though they have something that they want to do , either there are no free time for them or there are things that is not allowed to young people . Also , in order to achieve their goals in the future , it seems it is necessary to go to college and study in the field they want to study . Without that education , it is hard to get a job in the high position or to earn a lot of money .  Not only that , but also they need to listen to their parents because they are not adult yet . If the parent do n't agree with something that you want to achieve , you need to either give up or change your mind . There is actually no freedom for teens at school or at home . Older people are more able to do whatever they want because they have freedom and they do n't have financial problem because most of them work . Basically , they can buy anything they want without asking or getting permission to their parents , and they can also do whatever they want without being pressured under parents .  We do n't exactly know when a young person becomes a older person , but what we know is that when a person becomes old enough , they can enjoy their life doing whatever they want and they have more freedom than the young people .

I would disagree with the given statement i.e. `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .  I strongly feel that the best way to travel would be alone or with a bunch of people sharing similar interests . The reason for this would be for the simple fact that the tour guide would take you to a set of places which is the city is famous for and these places might not necessarily interest me in particular .  I would like to cite a simple example . Last year for the new years i had to gone to Goa ( which happens to be a major tourist destination in India ) . Goa is known for a lot of things . Great beaches , Brilliant Churches ( Goa was under the Portugese control for over 200 years , so lots of european influence in the architechture ) and a pretty rocking night life .  I and my friends decided against having a tour guide as `` Goan Music '' , in other words `` Psy Trance '' , interests us more than the churches or the beautiful beaches out there . The tour guide would have charged us a bomb for showing the churches , talking a bit about the local culture and walking us down the beaches ! We went to goa for the simple fact that it happens to be the hub for some great electronic music and since every one in my group was inclined to the same objective , all of us started exploring the city all by ourselves !  We bought some local maps , hired a couple of bikes , bugged people for directions and it all added to the experience ! I wouldnt have enjoyed it to this extent had i gone for a tour operator .  Guides are only out there to make money and in todays world , guides arent a neccessity while going on a trip because you have enough information available in the form of books , internet etc .  So i would strongly recommend to go alone and do away with a tour guide just beacuase it would add to the whole expereince of travel .	TEL
When a product is developed , there must be a way to introduce it to the public , and once it 's on the market , a way to increase its popularity and therefore its sales .  This is where advertisement comes in , to make the most sales and profits out of any kind of product , of any quality , and of any actual functionability , and I strongly emphasize `` of any quality , and of any actual functionability '' since most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .  I believe it has happened to all of us that we see a commercial on T.V. about a product that interests us , mainly because the function it will perform helps us in some way , or makes us more comfortable and happy , but when the product is purchased , it stands far from what we thought it would be or it would do . Many people try to look at this as a scam has been portrayed against them , but the truth is that advertisement was mainly doing its job , which is attrack potential buyers .  The advertisement 's purpose is to make you believe that this product is the best in quality , the best in price , and the best in its performance , in other words , its the best of the bests in its kind .  In order for marketing professionals to reach this goal they must study the behavior of the public this product is being intended for , its interests , its likes and dislikes , and even its dreams and routines , so that the product can be addressed in the most proper way and in the most proper time , presenting it as something that the potential buyer could never live without .  The truth is , that some products do live up to its advertisements and to the buyers expectations , but those are surely not the majority ; and in the rest of the cases I believe we just have to look out , and pay very close attention to the real message that its being sent when this advertisements are played and displayed anywhere thay are , because even if the marketing proffesional understands what my desires are and whay my behavior might be in front of a certain situation , he or she can not dictate what I will actually do , only I am in control of myself .

Advertising in the art of convincing customers to buy specific products . It is obvious that advertisements do not provide a complete information to the customers . That is not the original purpose , even if it provides sometimes useful information , and other ways exist for customers to get information about the products they want to buy . For example , a lot of independent websites compare all the models of the same product available in the market .  But even if advertisments are not supposed to provide a complete information , they often describe some features of the product . Doing that , they can not lie about objective characteristics because it is not legal and the advertisement would be forbidden by the competent authority .  Then , how advertisements can lie to the customers ? The way to describe a product can be very subjective and it is obviously the case for advertisement . For example , if you present a car with very beautiful girl or boy driving it , you do n't lie but you give the illusion that the car is better than it would be with a normal driver . That is seduction . A advertising is seduction . When you are interested in someone and you have a date you do not wear every day 's clothes . You take more time to appear `` much better than [ you ] really are '' . That is seduction too and nobody seems to be against this kind of `` subjective lies '' .  In my opinion , the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' is true but that is not a problem because everybody know that advertisements are subjective . There is a game of seduction between companies and customers . We have to know the rules and take part of the game . I think that the life would be less interesting without this kind of subjective communication , beyond technical descriptions .	FRE
I agree that the people nowadays do not devote enough time towards helping their communities . The communities can prosper only when everyone gets along and make the community better in many ways . these may be due to various reasons .  one reason is today people hav become so busy that they hardly have time to spend it with their communities they are so preoccupied with other matters that they dont give that much prefernece to whats going on in the community . They hardly are able to make enoungh time which can be spent with community let alone helping it .  Because of their complex lifestyles people generaly prefer to have time to spend in other intresting things than going to community and help others . even though it important to help communities one cant be forced into talking up the cause . the people can not be forced into doing communitiy services without their willingness . The people who do not do coommunity service does not know what it is all about the imagine it as one of the borin things in life .  Another thing which takes people away from helping communities is theit hectic schedule . the people usually work in weekdays and want to relax during the weekends . The consider helping service as job which makes them think whether they should get involved or relax and get ready for the next week .  Due to their poor knowledge regarding what is meant by ` helping their community ' also big factor which forces people away from the participating in community service . people should made aware of the effects the helping can make on the society it is for their betterment that this type of services are being conducted . The people are more concerened about themseleves and do not give much attention to the happenings in the society . For example lack of awareness people dont even now whats going on in their surroundings .  To conclude people are getting away from their duties . they tend to forget their responsibilities towards community which indeed is a larger family . Helping the community will only give satisfaction that he or she has contributed to the society in one way or another . thus people should try and make some time for helping others in community , which can only make the community better to leave in .

I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help the communities . In many organizations and foundations , there are a lot of young people working to help the communities . A lot of schools also require students to do community service . Sometimes doing community service is a relax for us . We young people do want to get involve in the communities .  Community service is required by most of the schools in United States . Students are required to do amount of hours whether they like it or not . By doing community service , students help in theirt communities and make time for the communities because they need to finish their community service requirement in order to pass the grade . Some school will also give out honors to those who work over the requirement . We students will work harder and give out more hours to the communities to gain those honors . Even though some studnets are not willing to do the community service , they still give out a lot of time to the communities because of the requirement .  A lot of young people give out their time to the communities to relax and get way from their school work . A lot of time students , including me , are tired of the school work and materials and want relax . I found helping the communities allows me to relax and not think about my work . At the same time , I 'm using my relaxing time to help my commuity and the people who need my help . It is benefitial to both my community and myself .  In conclusion , Young people nowadays do give enough time to help their communities in many way . Whether we young people do communities service for the school requirement or to relax from school work , we are giving time and energy to our communities and to get involve in the communities .	CHI
Most companies allot a huge amount to advertisment . Why do they do that ? Is is still beneficial after using thousands of dollars just on the advertisement ? As the matter in fact , it is . I actually read an artical about a drink advertisement using a Korean top star . The sales of the product has increase dramatically after advertisement . Why has this phenomenon happen ?  First , most advertiser tries to make a good image of the product through the advertisment to attract customers . There 's actually no one trying to complain their own product on TV . Hence , the consumers unconciously accept that the product on the TV or the papers are actually better through the images that the advertisement . For example , creating an image of beauty or health by using Jessica Alba on the picture makes people think that `` Oh , if I use that product , I will be beautiful and healthy like Jessica Alba . ''  Furthermore , advertisement put unconcious trust in people 's mind . It is an human instinct that the product that we know is better than others unknown . And advertisements make products more widely known . People just simply ca n't trust things that they do n't know about . Hence , by using the phenomenon , advertising creates a kind of fake trust on the product . For example , what would you use between a Pantene or a shampoo you never saw , even though you never used both . Most of the people would choose pantene because they know it .  Advertising is a kind of magic or trick that attracts people to use it and it 's actually the purpose of the progress . By soaking a pleasant image of Hollywood star , for example , and using the human instinct of preference to famous products , it paralyze people to buy them . However , we have to be aware that `` A picture means more than thousands of word . '' We have to experience ourselves than just experiencing through a TV .	KOR
I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Enjoyment in itself is symbolic for freshness . Age certainly is a big factor in determining the freshness at heart to enjoy life at the fullest .  The most important factor that supports this idea is that young people are away from responsibilities and day-to-day life woes . They are either dependent on their parents or have some support for themselves . This kind of independence enthuses them to feel free thereby adding on to the fun in their life . Older people are experienced and have families to look upon . Their domain starts and finishes with their families . So their enjoyment is limited to families , colleagues and near-ones . Moreover with the passage of time , the feeling of being satisfied with life increases . The needs shrink to bare minimum and emotional support dominates over feelings of enjoyment . Especially those who enjoyed a lot at a younger age tend to get away from enjoyment in older age . Take for instance , in countries like India and Sri Lanka , older people find pleasure in spiritual activities and become more inclined towards leading an ascetic life refraining themselves from enjoyment altogether .  Other factor that helps young people to enjoy life more is the state of their health , which certainly is better than older people . As age advances , the body does not allow all activities to be done they could be done during young age . For example young people can have no limits on eating , say , chocolates , but older people ca n't do so .  Young people , being adventurous at heart , tend to take challenges , make new friends and thus expand their social circle and broaden their horizon . On the other hand , older ones do not mix up so easily and rely on already built up relations . Another argument that favours the statement is that since older people have already enjoyed at some point of time in their lives , so they feel filled and complete in themselves and are left practically with no desire to enjoy . Thus it is quite convincing to believe that young people enjoy more than older ones .	HIN
Nowadays young people has change a lot , their education changes and they changes with it , is suposse to be a more liberal educacion with less rules and more freedom , but maybe we are giving freedom to people that is not ready to use it properly yet .  What I wanted to say with that is that young people today spends more time looking at themselves than trying to be part of the society .  Maybe is because they are living in a society that do not offers them what they are looking for and for that reason the are not in the mood to participate of their communities .  We are living in the telecomunications era . You can live without human touch . Without going out of your own house . Most of young people thinks that his communiti is to small for them so they use internet to feel they are part of something really great , to feel importans . They do not mind if his neighbour needs salt or if his hometown is clean or not . They are upon all that .  As an example I can use new kind of culture that I have red about in a magacine last week . It is a new way of life , it is very extended in Japan , and their philosophy of life is not to have any personal relation if it is not via internet . So they borke off whit their families and with their friends and they star living all by themselves . Using internet for everything , for working , make their shoping , make friends and all the natural things that we are use to do in our lives .  Hearing thing like that I have got the hoppe that maybe in the future young people will help their communities , maybe they would be cybercommunities but the main idea is to be part of something .

I agree this sentence . Young people every time enjoy life more than older people . In my opinion young people very active , make alot of sports , listening music , dancing , singing song , reading going cinema . but older people prefer to aloneto communite other people . young people doesnt like think life condations , financial problems by contrasting older people . Although young people very powerfull they dont interest any problems for instance ; national economy , envoiremental poisionus , starvy . They think every time enjoible things . in addition these young people spend as twice as older people . They dont like mension about their lessons . Where as older people like travellng , resarching events , reading observing events , listening romantic music .  Conculision being young people is very entertaining thing . young people chance and give to our life movement . if they dont have our life makes us unhappy . world is very active and peacefull them .

It is true that the youth of today are much different than they used to be in the past . Technological advancements leading to a more rapid pace of life has indeed brought about a revolutoinary change in young people nowadays . This has lead to the fact that they do not give enough time to helping their communities .  One of the most important reasons is the lack of time available to the young people for such activities . They are more involved in their career , family , social and sports activities . Hence , they seldom find it possible to take time out of their busy schedules .  Secondly , people are much more competitive nowadays . There is competiton in each and every field today . It is the time where only the fittest of people survive . Everyone wants to build a good career so that they can provide for their family as well as to ensure a bright and prosperous future . In this rat race , they are left with no time to think about those outside their family . Hence , they choose to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities towards their communities .  Lastly , they are not aware of their responsibilities and duties as individuals towards others . It is sad that few choose of them to remain so still . There is a need for awakening the youth so they become more aware .  There are few young people who have still managed to contribute largely to their community . There are many examples of television actors and other famous personalities who have made their mark by carrying out their responsibilities to the fullest . Such people are considered as role models by the common public and they inspire the youth of today to continue with their good work .  Thus , it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . However , it is necessary that they should be reminded of their duties as responsible and mature people who hold the key to the future of our nation .	HIN
Advertisements almost show the best thing that their product is realy good or great in . And even Advertisments hide the lack of quality of ther products and try to show that their product is better than the other product to earn more money from customers . As a result for that products seem much better in the advertisment .  For me advertisments make products look more better than it is . by using famous people such as players , singers and artists and that do n't make the product good or usefull . Therefore my opinon to see if the product is good or not is to ask people who use it . If a famoues player wear a certain shoes or singer eat in a restrunt for advertise they do n't do that because its good or great because they earn money from it . You ca n't make a decison untill you try it or ask about it .  But if the advertisment show some facts aout the product or record some of observatio	ARA
I agree with statement because I perceive more people engage through individual efforts or formal non-government organizations in helping communities that are in much poorer conditions than their own communities .  One might think that competition to succeed in today 's world would keep young people very busy and therefore overlook the need to help . However , young people are helping , but not necesarily in their neighborhood .  As communities achieve a better living standard , less is required to do if you are part of these communities , and efforts to help are redirected to people in real need , either because of natural disaster or structural poverty .  There is growing number of non-government organizations ( NGOs ) that raise funds to help poor people in less-developing countries . Entities such as the Red Cross , Oxfam , among others , are present with projects in those regions to help provide access to water , health , education and food .  Most of the volunteers working for these NGOs are young people that prefer to give a hand wherever is most required . The reason for having this outside-focus help is the improvement of communication and information systems . Today people is aware of what is happening worldwidenad where the need is more required .  Everybody is aware of the need to help others , regardless of the economic-oriented situation of companies . One example of this is that companies are more concerned about how others perceive their role in the society . Social corporate responsability has become a very important element in the decisions of companies that want to have a good reputation . They increase it by donating funds to NGOs so they can send people to help out there , not necesariuly in thei	SPA
In my opinion , I do not agree the statement , for I believe there are three major point that can help to increase the number of car : new resources , growing populations , and new technolgies . These elements will continue to push up demamds for cars .  First , we are now developong new energy resources substitute fossil fuels ; for example , solar energy and hydrogen energy . These energies have two fascinating points ; they are safe to environment without producing any chemical substances causing pollution problems . And , they are obtaind almost infinitely . By refining these new technoligies can be applied in twenty years and we can use car without harming our planet . That can be a strong element for the favor of cars .  Second , the convenient systems in cars are enhancing its ability . For example , today we can reach destinations without losing our ways thanks to the navigation system supported by satelite communication . Moreover , the safety of the car is improving ; the physical strength of the car body is becoming incredibly strong these days saving many drivers lives . These new supporting systems or technologies provide more confort to the car users , which means the consumption for the cars will keep strong in future .  Third , the rapid growth of population in the world is going on for at least twenty years . This means there will be growing demand for the cars continously . Although we are also tryng to create new type of trains such as renior motored car that is moved by magnetic power , I think people tend to buy cars that can provide safe energy and fabulous convenience . Actually , I experienced the subway newly constructed was not so used by citizens in New Delhi , India .  As stated above , there are three aspects supporting the stromg demands for cars : the development and applications of new resources , new technologies and systems gives drives more relaxing atmosphere , and the exposion of number of people who need cars in the world . In twenty years , it is quite sure .	JPN
Everybody could tell you this : young people enjoy life whereas older people do n't . To me , it ca n't be absolute , for several reasons . First , we know that young people know how to have fun . They always go out with friends , they always laugh ( most of time for nothing ) ... Older people do n't know it . They used to know but now they are adults and adults have a lot of responsibilities , adults always think about their work , adults always worry about everything ,,, and when they are older , they worry about death and always talk about when they were young , when they knew how to enjoy life !  We also could say that young people enjoy life because they do n't think about the future , they seize the day . . That 's true but older people , if they like to plan everything can seize the day too . Do n't we say that the better time of your life is when you do n't work anymore ?  What about these grandfathers and these grandmothers who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want ? That 's why I think middle aged people are the ones who enjoy life the least . They have too much things not to forget , too much things to do , too much things to care about . . Young peole enjoy life because they have nothing to think about ! They go to school , go out with their friends , have complicated relationships with their boyfriends and girlfriends and that 's all . . OK , they have to do some homeworks , but that 's not a horrible life . They enjoy life because their life is perfect !  To finish , I would say that although they have a perfect life most of young people do n't really enjoy life . Adolescents are always in a bad mood , they complain everytime , they always disagree with you , but what they do the best is `` to not care '' . But older people , even if they have a quite more difficult life , know the value of life .	FRE
I disagree the statement said about how advertisement are . There are several reasons .  Firstly , an excesive advertisement confuses the consumer . Usually , the consumer buy the goods based on the information that the company advertised . When the goods are not what they tought about , they must be confused . For me , I want to lose my weight , so I buy the execesise machine . The advertisement said I could lose my weight without suffering , and thet was very attractive for me . I immediately decided to buy the machine . Once use of that , I found that it is very difficult to use and demanding . I gave up the using the machine .  Secondly , I think that the companies by which the excesive advertisement prevailed lose their repetition . As I suffered that probrem mentioned above , I do not have any confident toward the company . The company have still sold the same machine and the progress method of the losing the weight , I perfectly doubt for the advertisement , if they were acutually good for me .  Thirdly , that is not good at my country 's society . Although excesive advertisement is needed for gaining more money , it does not permit by the nations . That is telling a lie to the customer . Once permitting that advertisement , it would be wide spread all over my country . That situation is not good at my country 's society . For example , foods are to be sold with the deadline of comsumption , because that food is safe to eat . But rcently , date deadline of comsumption date is intentionally changed by the company . This is very discoraged toward my country 's nation .  So that reasons , I disagree with the statement .	JPN
In my opinion , there could be great success for people who have inclination to do different from others . Although some might say the such people tend to have failure because of the high risk , I think that most of them have success in terms of their personal acheivement .  I prefere the idea that people should try to do best within their ability and resources . And , even if they fail , I think they have had their own success . This success means that breaking the own limitation could be happiness for people . For example , there was a man , who quitted a big company and start a small coffee shop . Even though he was so enthusiastic to make the shop profitable , he eventually went bankrupt . I saw , however , in some magazine which covered his faliure story , the man said he felt so happy because I could know my limitation . I think that knowing own limit could be success since it could be helpful for people to have good life in their future .  And , it could be too much easy to do what others can do easily . In this circumstance , even though people can have some profit , I can not say it is success . For instance , after Henry Ford introduce a commercialized car for ordinary people , many car makers tried to follow to jump in the car industry . Neverthless , they were just followers . They did just what Ford did . While some car makers still making great profits , in my opinion , they are not truly succeful . They imitate what the great man did .  Of course , the followers can have great success . They can reduce costs and attract consumers a lot . They might be some kind of successful people . I think , however , the truely succesful people are the people who did new things and take high risks .	JPN
Youngsters and community aid  I believe the implication of young people in helping their community will vary from one country to another . Focusing In my home country , Spain , I must say that I do agree in general terms with the statement proposed .  The decline in social concern that western countries like Sapain are experiencing is due , in my opinion , to two main factors : the improvement in the quality of life of middle class families and the reduction in the size of families .  Spain has changed a lot in the past thirty five years . While some decades ago we still had a considerable proportion of our population living in conditions of poverty , that is not the case anymore . Middle class has boosted in Spain and nowadays it is one of the countries with the most disperse distribution of wealth . In this new situation there are less class differences and therefore the need of helping the community is not so evident to young people .  Another important social change in Spain has been the dramatic sreduction of average family size . Thirty years ago there were very seldom one-child families in Spain . Today , this is the most common situation of families . One-child families usually tend to over-protect the lonely child , and these children become less concerned about social aspects of life . Therefore they do not spot the need to help the community afterwards when they grow up and become youngsters .  These two reasons just express my opinion and must be taken in general terms . I am sure there are a lot of other reasons why young people do not give time to helping the community , but I consider these two as the most important ones . It is also important to take into account that there are exceptions , I know young people that devote a lot of time to help their cummunities and even some that work full time in fields related with community aid , but I just feel this is not the general behavior of this generation .

Comparing to previous generations , many of today 's young people have forgotten the importance of their community . Instead , they are now focusing on their own leisure times , such as playing video games and watching television .  It is a fact that many young people do not give enough time to helping their communitires . Since today 's development of technology , many things seem fascinating to people . Especially to the young people , who are curious about the society . There are too many things that young people want to experience and try , and it also includes many negative things , such as smoking and drinkging . Unlike today 's people , our previous generations learn to treasure their communities because they felt responsible to their own environment ; it is something they were told when they were young .  Unfortunately , today 's values are different from before ; people concentrate on physical enjoyment . But , while they are experiencing the sensation of enjoyment , they are also ignoring their obligations to their communities and society . In schools , we all have learned to be responsible to our surroundings ; however , many of us have forgotten the real concept of this responsibility .  Further , there are many examples of helping communities . For an example , maintaing the cleaness and order of community is everyone 's obligation because everyone is a part of the community . But , the many young people do not realize the importance of this obligation . When the elders ask them for some working , they are usually respond with bad or unpleased attitudes ; they think it is a waste of time to help the community . By looking closely , I see many negative things that will happen as those young people become adults . Our society will be decadent if the government is ruled by lazy people ; more scarily , it is not only a joke but a truth of today 's young men .  However , our society have already realized the importance of correcting the young people 's attitudes . They first begin the work at school by requiring community service for each student before they graduate from schools . This is an important step to start with , because school is the place where everyone goes to . Besides the effect of community service , many schools now also spreading the idea of protecting our environment . Personally , I see these two things are start to work in many young minds .  Finally , before we act anything , we should first notice that Earth is our home ; we are all the owner of this planet ; therefore , while we are enjoying our physical happiness , we should also do something for our community . The community is not only our home but also belong to our offsprings . Even a bit of work we contribute to the community can make a change in society . Lastly , we should provide a clean and healthy environment for our children .	CHI
The development of the car is an uncertain issue . Actually , people used to live without cars but since it has been created , there have been more and more cars all around the world . Yet , I trully believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .  First of all , considering all the new technology and the constant evolution of the world , I 'm convinced that the car will finally disappeared . Actually , people change their mind very fastly nowadays and they will soon be bored by the car , they 'll need something new . For instance , I hope we 'll soon be able to move just by thinking about the place we want to go , it will be easier and will save energy and time . Besides , even if the teleportation is n't created , it 's obvious that the car will disappear as fastly as it came . Thus , a new mean of transport will be created , more powerful and more useful .  Furthermore , all the country are getting engaged for the reduction of toxic gas on earth and Kyoto agreement is the perfect example of the world we all want to fight for . Even if some countries do n't really apply the rules at the moment , I 'm sure they will finally realize what the emergency is and they wo n't have any other choice than making efforts . Moreover , people are more and more aware that we are acting for the future and for the next generations . Therefore , if we want the future humans to be able to live on earth in the future , we have to stop using the car and then stop polluting .  In a nutshell , even if I 'm not sure that there will be more and more pedestrians , I 'm trully convinced that cars do n't belong to future but to past and that we 'll find solutions to be able to move as we wish without polluting too much .

I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . When advertising , companies tend to make their products sound like that they are the best by providing false informations and false results .  An ad on the TV may tell you things that you usually want in a product . These information may misslead you to build an idea about the product that usually terns out to be wrong . For example , when you watch television , you see a commercial about a certain type of cleaners . On the commercial , they say that this cleaner can make old things look new . You immediately think that this cleaner will help you make your old dress made by your mother look like a new Valinteno . But instead , it shrinks your dress .  Other commercials , show what happened when other people - actors - used this product . For example , a company that sells a drug for weight loss will show images of people who used to be fat , but now they are in a good shape . Later , it turns that these images were either taken for different people , or were manipulated with by computers .  When conpanies try to make their products seem much better than they really are , they fool people into buying their products . People will see later that this product is not like what they expected . This will eventually leads the company to lose its creditability and honesty , which will lead to financial nose dive in the future .	ARA
It is often said that group tour is more beneficial than travel alone . Some people might agree with this statement because group tour is not lonely and a tour gruide will guide best travel attractions . However I firmly believe that travel alone is the best way to travel . It is far more comfortable . Also I can do what I really want to do without any regulations .  To begin with , a single tour makes me feel very comfortable . Usually group tour is little bit noisy and confusing . But individual travel will be possible to a calm , peaceful and cozy tour . For example , when I was going to Japan , I went there with group . Our tour group members were 15 . So every we moved other location , I had to wait until all members were ready to move . Waiting too much was made me anger . After came back to my country I thought if I had go to japan alone , it will be a much great memorable travel for me .  Also , individual travel gives a great opportunity to encourage independence and endurance . When people travel alone , there are no regulation so people can do what they really want to do . They should planned by oneself and should decide what they eat and where they house . By deciding these things they will be learn many things which could n't learn on the books . For instance when I was senior , I planned to go to america for 4weeks . I did reserve airplanes , restaurants and hotels . At that time . it was very hard time for me . But now , I think through these tour , I can be learn independence , improve my language skills , and broaden my social relationships .	KOR
I completly agree with satement about the most advertisements , there are no of things to be consiredered in this aspect . firstly to say about the advertising of cellular services like hutch and airtel communication system they advertise they are the best in the market in terms of cost , efficiency and service . once we get into the their services they start leveing all the hidden cost which does n't appear at the time of advertising . this is really sort of cheating the people .  secondly there are no of products in the market , their advertisment showing the best appearence , which makes us feel like the real one , when we start using them they dont meet the expected levels , eventhough the cost is high , for example soaps , shampoos , and variety of cosmetics avalable in the market , here appearence of the object and the way they are presented make us easil attracted and buy them .  thirdly the most of the advertisements use the clebrities for advertisements which make a lot of impact on the products , people just buy them only because thier favoutite star has advertised for it .  in India most of drinks like coke , pepsi are advertised by the famous local film stars , and people started using them , eventhough they are proved to contain harmful residues of pesticides , after a concern of the media they reduced their usage .  in some context they make us feel they are modified products , eventhough in reality they are not done so , the world has completly paced itself to the world of advertisement , a product any comidity can be made success only by advertising ,  to sum up , it is one of the biggest magic or thing to the manufacturers to sell thier products or commidites in the market , at the expense of peoples faith , in their products .

Although some people like to learn things that they want to use in their real life , i like to spend more time on the theories and i want others do the same thing as well . There are several reasons : to advance our world , to contribute for a better fututre and to satisfy our needs .  Many people think that human beings improved their life a lot and they are the ruler of the planet , earth , i disagree . For example , a century ago , we even did not have electricity . What scholars did was to develop theories and to care about science . For instance , if we did not have Einstein or Edison or other scholars , there would not have been electricity or new discoveries . We may have been countinued our life with primary machines and in dark houses .  Moreover , we have tremendous problems in our world . Even though we have computers , rockets and flying cars , the end of the world may too close . For example , the global warming contains a big threat and we need to save our world . How can we solve this problem ? Most likely by thinking more about science ( theories ) , we probabely will solve the problem . In fact , we need more scientists to pay attention to this area and we need to encourage new generations to take science courses and think more about theories .  We do not have plenty of foods and resources and we need to improve them more . Without spending energy on the theories behind the genetically modified foods , it would be imposible to grow healthier and numerous foods . For example , I used to pay two dollars for a pound of apples containing a lot of diseases , now i pay less for better apples .  Summing up , without spending more time on the theories , we could not improve our life standarts and i appriciate to the all scientists devoided their time on them .	TUR
I mainly agree with the statement that people enjoy life more when they are young than when they get older . But some details need to be analysed to proove this idea .  The first point is related to brithday anniversaries . It is common that children and teenagers are often very happy when they get one year older . This is often related to presents , parties , and lots of friends wishing a happy birthday . But old people , are very often sad and ashamed of getting older , and they anniversary remind them of those feelings .  The way people enjoy life depends on their age . It is different if we consider children , or teenagers , or adults .  Children seem to be happy very often . They can enjoy any little trick during hours and keep smiling and laughing without any relevant reason . Children do not have to worry about important things , indeed , they even do not know about them thanks to their parents that try to keep them apart of any troubles .  The way of enjoying life changes as the children become teenagers . The main reason of teenagers enjoying life is freedom . Even this often goes along with little fights with their parents , teenagers have the will to create their freedom by prooving that they can be independant . As they feel free , teenagers have new hobbies , sometimes forbidden , but they enjoy the risks they take .  In opposition with the happyness of children and teenagers , adults can not enjoy life as easily . Being an adults means having reponsabilities . Adults have to work to earn money and have lots of bonds which keep them out or entertaining and enjoying life . Moreover , when adults have children , they manage to offer their children the happiest life they can . So they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own happyness to the benefit of their family . But even if that is difficult , parents enjoy every little moment of happyness they can share with their children .	FRE
I agree with it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learm facts . bucause today at every school , every students only learn fact . even they do not understand what teacher talking about . I think it is not good for young students . if teacher read and teach what is on the book , they would think about same thing . In addition , It would make children 's free imagination down . getting down student high score is one of the big problems in the world . especially in japan , I heard on the television that there is no student who read a book often , do not like learn new things and they do not know why is so imprtant to do study .  I think all teacher must teach childrens to get interested in to know new idea , not only the fact . children should think about their own ideas . It will makes them more intelligent and interested person . other big problem is most of japanese can not speak english . and I saw the graph on the news , They said japan was worst . in the high school , student will learn english form teachers who is not native speaker . they studies such as grammer and how to talk . I think it is not very useful for students . they have to learn listening , writing and need chance to talk to people who speak english . It will also make student to intersted and easy to undersatnd in class . I do not think only learn fact is bad but I guess If student learn that , They would lose their indivisual idea and sense of imagination . that 's why I think , to understand ideas and concepts is more important to learn real facts .

In today 's global environment , some people prefer to do routine tasks to be successful , others prefer to create new things to be successful . Personally , I believe that successful people try new things and take some risks instead of doing routine things .  Firstly , people who try new things and take risks are generally succesful making profits in business environment . In these days , the most of the corporations prefer innovative employees . Innovation means creating new ideas such as new products and new services . The new products which are done by corporations especially , employees are successful . As a result , these companies can have higher profits . Generating new ideas and things can provide success for an employee . For example , I had an internship experience in my country two years ago in summer . I observed that managers who are in high level positions always talk about innovation . Also , they suggested that I should be open to new ideas .  The second important point is the demand in the world . In today 's world , in soceity people have higher demands with regards to the products and the services . When a buyer buys a new product , one can be bored with this new products in two or three months . To provide new products , the market needs people who can take risks to create new things can be successful . For example , Bill Gates who is the owner of the Microsoft Company is the best example of this situation . When Bill Gates first developed the Windows , he went to IBM to sell his product . However , IBM rejected his offer and he set up his own country . As a result , he has become the owner of the highest valuable company , and his products are used in most part of the world . He is successful , because he took some risks and created new things which is benefical to the soceity .  The other important point is life satisfaction . People are born , because they want to survive and create new things . Every people have skills to create new things . So , they use their skills .  To sum up , the successful people always generate new ideas and takes risks for their trial . In most cases they are successful and happy . Routine tasks are boring things and people who do routine tasks have not enough life satisfaction .	TUR
Advertisements are usually a particular kind of product developed form many people working together , each one with a different role and each one with different skills . Those people are paied from companies and they have a great interest in improving companies ' profits just because if they don-t they risk to loose their jobs . I think this is enough for showing how advertisement presents products in better way then the one tey really are .  First when a company decide to spend money in advertisement it ' s usually waiting a reward from that . An advertisement campaign is costly . For this reason they expects more people will buy the product in order to achieve an higher profict .  This is why people who produce advertise has to attract more buyers that their competitors and so will try to present their products as the best products people can desire to buy . They must convince people if they buy that they are doing the right chooise .  Second people who are payed to produce advertisement have a lot of different skills , they usually know a lot about marketing and they know who they are going to refear to sell the product .  For examples some days ago I was in the library and I was really surprised when some boys and girls near me began to talk about a marketing research project they were developing .  They did n't care at all about the quality of the product , they care just about how to sell it . They tried to find the best way of convincing people and did n't care at all about beeing honest in the way they had to do that .  Moreover I can surely add some personal experience . For example , I 've got an eleven years hold sister always asking my mom for many products she sees in advertisements . Sometimes my mother buys her the product she wants and even if she spends a lot of money doing that often they are not hight quality products . I noticed this can happend easily for products they sell to kids or teen-agers just because this public usually care less about quality and more of how the product itself appears .  In conclusion my opinion is that advertisement is often a way of earning more proficts for companies or a way of creating a brand name . The market itself is cometitive . How can they reveal the weaknesses of their products ?	ITA
Traveling is when a person or group of people move form one place to another either to vist a place or for a particular reason . As traveling has proved to be fundamental for many countries economy . Many country in the world benefit form the tourist who come to vist their country as it leads to increase in the entertainment sector , hotel sector , employment sector , the forign currency which they receive and the infrastructure of that country gradually improves .  Yes I do agree with the following statement that the best way to trravel is in a group led by a tour guide . First a fall , the tour guide would probably know about the place where the group is traveling . He would have taken the essential measures which are required to be taken for that particular place . Such as a group is traveling to a hostile area where the roads not properly construced , the climate is too cold and there are possible chances to be injured . Hence the tour guide would have taken the medical aid equipmet , he would taken care of where to sleep , and he would have made a list of place which are worth visting .  People who travel in a group which is led by a tour guide are relaxed as the guide would have given the list of the equipment which is required , the places to see would already be known and the number of days they are going to vist would be known . Where as if an individual travel would take precaution there is to be taken he would carry extra thing which he would not require . He would have no idea what are the place to be seen also what time they are open . He would be worried about various things unlike the people who travel in a group . Also people who trave in a group are not tensed about the initial problem which an traveler faces such as food , where to stay , and who much would the trip cost him in the end as all the group member would have to pay a fixed price . These are the reason to travel in a group	HIN
I disagree . I have three opinion to support this reason . First is the way to travel with a group led by a tour guide is not free to active . they made me unhappy to put me just one couse where we have to go and even scasuling when we should go there . In everywhere , maybe we could find impresst on the specific place , but i can not stay more the place such a hard scasule or with the group .  Second is it seems inexpensive on the surfece , but they let me spend mony little by little , as adittional praice . if i traveld alone , prohaps i can more economicaly to staty the city in oder to make fraiends .  Threrdly , We can not to make many local friends in the trip , if i led a such group . if traveled up to alone , i can more closs to the local tradison .  therefore , i disagree the way that led by a tour guide .

Have you ever try to figure out the hard and complicating math questions ?  Some people suggest that it is important for students to learn the fact . On the other hand , i think that understanding the concepts is much more important than just learn the facts . I suggest my opinion with two reasons , people will remember longer when they understands the ideas and they will also figure out all the questions even though it 's hard and complicating .  First of all , people tend to remember longer when they understands the concepts or the ideas . However , when they just learn and memorize the facts . They will forget about it quickly . For instance , in biology , I learned about the ` Feedback system ' in human 's body and I was able to understand how this system works because my mother knew about the biology very well . However , my friend , who did n't get halep from anyone , just memorized and learned the whole process of the ` Feedback system ' and a week ago , we had a pop quiz in the biology class . I was managed to figure out all the questions about the ` Feedback system ' but my friend could n't solve non of the questions . In this case , i was able to answer all these questions because I understood how the ` Feedback system ' worked then my friend could n't answer them because he forgot what he memorized and learned before .  Secondly , students can figure out any hard questions if they fully understand the facts or the ideas . This happens a lot in math classes . Math teachers do n't just ask students easy and simple questions , they make the questions complicated and hard for students to solve it . Students who understands the ideas would be able to solve these questions . However , students who just memorized or learned the facts will be confused or hesitated to figure out the questions because they have the basic knownledge about the concepts and ideas .  Since , students do n't forget or mis-use the knownledge when they understand the consepts and students , who understand the ideas and the concepts , will manage to figure out all the hard and high-leveled questions . Above all , I state understanding the facts and the ideas are much important than just learning the facts .	KOR
I do agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they are . This should come to no surprise as an advertisement by definition responds to an aim . The aim is not to give an information to the consumer ( for which there is the press ) , but rather , to make the particular pruduct more appealing . An advertisement is supposed to increase the sales of a particular product , which is sold for a profit of course . So the manipulation of the human individual is the purpose of the advertisement .  Advertisements are sponsored and financed by the producer , who essentially dictates what they should say . This fact is known to everybody , so it is even fair to do some overtstating within limits . Of course there are consumer protection laws in all western countries . These laws discourage an advertiser from making outright false claims . So , realistically , outright lies are probably uncommon in advertisement .  However within this limitation , it is rather easy to make non verifiable statements or suggestions , which are neither true nor a lie . Anti-aging , cosmetic products are typical examples . Of course , nobody suggests that you can stop aging . But , most advertisements for such products do implictly suggest it as an undelying , implicit , message , without explictly saying it , by the layout and setting of the advertisement etc . Cosmetic products ' advertisements always show fresh , young characters who have no issue with aging . ..  Also , advertisers usually try to convey a dream , a feeling , and not a rationaly verifiable message . For instance advertisements for expensive cars , watches and generally luxury goods always advertise the quality and substance of the product , which is greatly overstated , but in the end , the customer buys it for intangible reasons , such as prestige and exclusivity associated with owning a luxury product . It is unrealistic that a expensive swiss manual watch is more reliable , precise , than a cheap chinese copy . .. But that is not the point .	FRE
I strongly believe the statement of , it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Understanding the idea is more important for every student in the class room . the understanding the idea and concepts give the overall picture of that particular lecture .  for example in my college days i had more concentrated on my lesson , at that time i know the central idea of the topic . This type of skills will improve the ability of study and ability of remembering . This skills are also reducing the study time . the students can learn more in formaton quickly .  learn facts is good but every time we dont want to study . We dont want to sparemuch time on learn facts . At that time these skills are very helpful . It is very time consuming process . understand ides and concepts will helpful any time . for example i want to go to exam , first i will go to through the topic then understand the main idea of that topic and concept of that one . I regularly follow this rule of studying . So in this way i get more information with in time , i save my time also . In this way os studying igot good marks in my exams .  For example we will go one reading passage first of all we skim the passage then get the main idea of the passage . this time the reading is easy otherwise it will tough . In this way of getting ideas studens get lot of exposure , the thinking ability will also increase . In this way learning facts is difficult to rembering with idea of the topic . So i strongly believe this statement , it will helpful alot in education and futere aspects .	TEL
It is not arguable that if one wants to be successful , one must seek for new things so that one can be differed from usual and common people . When one just opens business , one can be hardly successful if the one only tries to use system that is already exist in the world . It might be safe to operate business with common systems and to produce famous products for profits and money ; however , that business will not grow beyond the any other companies or businesses . To be successful , it is important to try new stuffs even though it seems risky . This contention is lucidly manifasted in history of Mc . Donalds and book ` Le Papillon ' .  The owner of Mc . Donald , Mr. Kropper , once started business with just restaurant as usually as any other common restaurants . However , the owner thought that it did not bring him lots of profits . He wanted to use new system of selling his foods to people . Mc . Donald came up with the an idea about fast food . It began to produce hamburgers rapidly to follow the trend of time period of his days . People were started to open up the new business , they did not have much time to spend in the restaurant with eating . Mc . Donald made food faster so that busy business people could pick up the ordered food , pay and leave to their places . It was once very successful . Kropper still did not satisfy with this policy . As the usage of cars increased , he once more thought of faster way to pick and and move , ` Drive-Thru . ' People liked it and nowadays , Mc . Donald is one of the famous restaurants that is worldly known . It was pretty risky policy to develop during that time . Other members of the company rejected this idea because people might not come to his restaurant with great pleasure . However , Kropper had insight to see further future and to try new things . He was one of the successful people who tried new things with risks .  In the book ` Le Papillon ' , written by Bernard Werber , it loculently clarifies that trying new things get you new world . Protagonists of this book are sick of their world because of the corrupted medias and selfishnes of people . There are several protagonists , but one of the protagonists who is scientist first comes up with the idea of escaping earth project . Not many people in the world would not fund him project , who illustrates people that did not like risks . However , another protagonist , rich businessman steps up and gives the funds for projects . Any other businessman or scientists think that plan is too risky and impossible to become real life . The project required budget is spiked high that it is very risky for businessman to funds all the money for project . However , the project is very successfully done as a result . When the protagonists get to leave the earth with the spaceship , people those who opposed his idea and risks do not get to leave the earth . It is great success for those who try new things and take risks for their future .  The game that I currently play even shows that it is good to have risky quests for greater rewards . Important fact is that trying the risky way for more experience and greater success rather than just keeping things that already know how to do well just as appealed clearly in the history of Mc . Donalds and in the book `` Le Papillon . ''	KOR
I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . There are maily three reasons for my opinion . First , the advertisement agencies over-publicizes a product . This is particularly done in the case of a launch of a new product in a market . Since , no one has ever consumed the product , the companies have an added advantage of referring to their product as best in the market , without the need of any facts to proove it . It is , after the product launch , that consumers read reviews about the new product and realize its exact worth .  Another reason is that , most advertisements includes creative ideas , which entice various fantasies in consumers . The consumers start to believe that they might come true if they started consuming that product . Sheer curousity of consumer for that product , forces him to buy and consume it . It is shortly after that that the consumer realizes that he is not in any super natural state , which he thought to be in while consuming that product . This results in lost of trust of consumers in the brand .  Third , nowdays there is an increasing participation of renouned personalities in advertisements for various products . For example , a new range of nike sport shoes is being endorsed by a leading soccer player or a complete range of clothes being supported by a famous celebrity . As these famous personalities have a very large fan base over the world , it leads to incorporation of blind trust in these brands by their followers . Who want to be like their on screen idols in their lives . People does not even search for reviews on these products or at least consider the use of these products in their lives .  Advertisements should display appropriate contents in them , so that consumer is not mis-guided by their curousity . Products should consider this so that it may not result in loosing their brand name .	HIN
About this topic , different people have different point of view . However I think that is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  First of all , we should know what is advertisement , that is a way to sell the products the company make , so that means the advertisement has to makes the products attractive to people , that is a main reason leads people decide to buy it or not . For example , if you want to sell cookie , you may want to more and more people to buy it so you have to catch people 's eyes . You may need to use some technology to improve your cookie 's feature . Like the color should be more bright or make a suggestion that how to eat this cookie by the best way . Thereby , that is impossible just to use the original feature of your cookie to make its advertisements . So you have to make your cookie seem much better than it really is .  Also , there have a interesting thing that advertisements may trick the kids to interested about the products , like transformer advertisement . In that advertisement , you will see that transformer can flys . We all know that is impossible because the transformer even not exsists . So when you buy a transformer to your children , they may dissappoints about this toy , because this is different from what they see from the transformer 's advertisement . That is another reason advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Beside that , competition is anotrher reason that advertisements m - ake products seem much better than they really are , because this is a competition society , all the businessman are compare with others , so advertisements is another way to improve their business , so that sometimes , they may focus on the affection of advertisements instead the quality of the products . When you watching the advertisement , you may have desire to buy it , that only prove that the advertisement of products affects you but not the real products , becuase before you want to buy it , you may even never use or taste the products before .  From what has been discussed above , we could safety draw the conclusion that Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	CHI
I agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do it '' .  The reason i agreed is beacause i think you can not make succes if they did what they already know haw to do . if YOU know how to do it , then other people would know as well .  you try new thing and that gives us the impact , maybe this is the way to be successful .  However i do not think you can succeed by randumly making new ideas . you do need to search on them , you need reason and proof to come up with the idea . Also you may need some help from other peolpe who has been through and experienced it .  For example president of clothes shop called UNIQLO . i think it is one of the most famous clothes shop in japan now days . He made so many new project , and he actually tried . But failled so many times too . He presented to us mass producing . first of all , they started to making simple designed clothes and sold them with very cheep price . Before UNiQLO did this way of selling clothes , every one would of thought it was not very good idea of producing so many same designed , cheep , simple clothes . Because they thoght that costumers want to buy something more individual and good quality .  However UNIQLO succeeded by selling products this way . But i have also seen them failling quite badly , that was when they started to selling vegetables and frite at the shop . It was an very big impact on us too like the last time . what kind of clothes shop sell vegetable at the shop ? but it did not make a seccessful ending . they stopped selling it after few months . It made such a loss for the company . But the president of UNIQLO still does not stop producing new ideas and project . that is why the company is still growing and making a lot of money .  i have come to the conclusion that i think even other people think you will not success with it and stop you , they can be wrong sometimes . you might fail a lot of times before you actually become a successful person . But that is the way to success so you should not be afraid , you need to take risk and try .	JPN
I strongly disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . There are several reason what I have . Young people is a process to old . We should save money for our old lives . There are a lot of young people who study in college or university or career institute . They are trying to improve themselves ' ability because they want to get higher career and pay . Young people are healthier than old people and more flexible to get new information . So they can get more chance to get a job and earn money . Imagine that if you should work and earn money although you are so old . It is very hard to old people . I know two people that would be good example for this topic . One man was worked very hard and saved money during he is young . So several years later , he married and he bought a beautigul house and he could spend enough money to educate his children . However another man did n't save money and did n't work hard . He enjoyed his youth . He drank beer with his friends and bought expensive clothes and bought a expensive gift to give to his girlfriend . So several years later , although he married , he still has lived rent house . Of course , we can enjoy our life during we are young . I 'm not talking about that enjoying life during youth is bad . A lot of new experience , and traveling are important to young people . However , we need to more improve ourselves during we are young . There are some cartoon about two kind of insect . Ant worked very hard for summer , so he could enjoy his life and rest for cold winter . In constrast , another insect just enjoyed and sang a song in the tree for summer . Conwequently , he could n't eat anything during cold winter . Think about it . Is n't it easier that young people try to study and earn money ? Young people are healthier and more enthusiastic than old people .  When we get old , we should take a rest and enjoy our left life . To enjoy our old life , we should save money .	KOR
I think that if things are still in twenty years like theyre going today , its very likely to be much more cars in use then , than they 're now , so i dont agree whith the given statement .  Although petroleum is likely to run up before those twenty years pass , i think there might be some other products or substances to be burnt to take the necesary energy that drives a car . Its not an illusion and even today there are appearing the first cars that use other substances , such as propane or any other gases , on the market .  I think that when twenty years have passed by , this technologies will be enough developed to let cars move with no petroleum needings . This doesnt mean that they wont harm our environment , which might be really harmed by then , but i dont really think noones going to change anything to prevent or solve the environmental problem , as long as noone has untill today .  People could maybe stop using their own cars when the earth gets so much heatened that living in it gets impossible , or at least very annoying , but i dont think that is going to happen between the next twenty years , and the car 's commerce is so powerfull that nobody is going to take care of preventing the use of cars before heat gets to be unstandable .  As i think this wont happen , and cars have shown to be a very likely product to be sell , i mean , cars are very well positioned and adapted to cities and citizens lifestyles all over the world , its very probable that cars get on their sells as they 've been untill now , so the new cars should be added to the old to finally detect a big increase in the total number of them .  Not only this , but if looking at the rest of the world , and not only developed countries , we will find that some big countries are being developed nowadays , like China or India , and they are potential car consumers in a very close future , which , of course , includes the next twenty years	SPA
Nowadays , travel agencies are providing tourists with various kinds of traveling programs with a tour guide which are designed by agencies beforehand . These pragrams are quite conveninet because we do not have make efforts to make schedules on our own and we are led by a tour guide with a reserved tour bus . However , I do not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .  To begin with , we can not have great fun and excitements which are felt while we make plans for a trip for ourselves if we use a traveling program with a guide . I realized the importance and fun of planning my trip by myself when I prepared for a trip to Europe in the last summer . I had the trip with two of my friends , so we met frequently to decide which place we are going to visit , what we will eat , what to buy as a souvenir , etc . I think that we had equally or even more interesting time or even more exciting time while we make our schedule and imagine our trip compared to actual traveling . A group traveling led by a tour guide is already planned by travel agencies , so we can not make our unique and special choices and plans .  Additionally , we will be probably restricted to the group 's decision and behaviors even if we have different ideas . For example , we can have some chances to choose what to eat even though we travel in a group . However , in this case , we should follow a certain choice that many people selected . It is a really sad thing that we can not eat exotic foods that we really want while traveling foreign countries . Furthermore , we can not take public transportations because of a reserved tour bus . I found it very interesting and impressive to take other countries ' subways , trains , buses and trams during my trip . I must have missed that precious experience if I had traveled in a group led by a tour guide .  In conclusion , I am convinced that traveling in a group with a guide is not the best idea to travel . We can have really interesting and exciting moments while we make our original and free plan for our trip . We also can behave freely if we are not included in a group . We can eat whatever we want , go to wherever we want , and even decide to take risk or advantures when we travel by ourselves . Besides , we can experience minor things which are done by residents of a foreign country such as riding public transportations and walking along rivers and streets . These are great advantage of traveling by ourselves individually .	KOR
As far as I am concerned that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . While it is true that some facts have to learn like the fire is hot , most ideas and concepts is understood by students . For one , to understand ideas and concepts is able to be mine . In addtion , it easily knows and learns .  To begin with , to understand ideas and concepts learns by experience . Indeed , any facts ca n't know only to learn . It is no secret that it is better doing at once than looking at something by tenth .  It is also true that it is mine easily . This is especially true that person 's memory does n't remain the brain long time , but some ideas or concepts just just	KOR
I reckon this statement has to be regarded in a more dimensional way . On the one hand , I agree that learning facts is significant but on the other hand , only understanding ideas and concept allows students to really move something .  Learning facts , a deductive method , is according to my view an important basic to invent something , do research or work on new programmes for the governement or society in general .  To illustrate my thesis , I would like to explain how my father works . My father does research concerning synapes , the junctions between neurons . Together with his student research group at the university in Munic , he reflected all the known facts about neurons . That was the basic for the research and experiments .  After being aware of the way a signal is transfered from one cell to another , they started working on concepts how the information transfer can be blocked . Therefore , they employed poisons like atropin which is responsible for rejecting specific neurons to pass a cell membran .  With this illustration , I would like to emphasize the combination of knowing facts and discovering concepts .  Another example which conveys my opinion very well is the political system . Of course , a student can learn all the facts about the German democratic system , for example that it was established after World War II with the help of the Americans , Britains , French and ( former ) Soviets etc etc but this is not necessary when he should think of new opportunities of citizen participation .  Facts are sometimes an important , essential basic or background but to be innovative and creative it must be guaranteed to have understood the gist of an idea or concept .  Drawing a conclusion , I would advice the students to learn facts and regard them as a measure of understanding sophisticated ideas and concepts without any problems .	GER
YES , i agree this statement , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than the there are today '' .  At present technology has been improved . At same time cars model are increased . In twenty years past there only two or three models of cars available . But present there are some models of cars and with technology cars are manufacturing . There will keep the people in safe mode even if accident will appear .  For example in olden days there facility to see television in the car , listen music in the car . It used only for travelling purpose . But at present by reading newspaper also we can drive car . That much has been improved the technology . If car has been accident there is no harm to the human beings because all safety has been arranged in the car . The old cars are polluting the climate so much by leaving smoke . But the present cars are using the gas instead of petro or disel . It will reduce pollution of climate . In past cars this facility is not available . Different cars have different technologies . At present populations also increased at same timeusage of car also incerased .  Finally i conclude that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . At persent technology cars have good selling in the maarket .	TEL
I do agree with the statement . I think successful people is always seeking new thing which normal people never have done generally . They are never afraid of failure . Taking the big risk brings the huge success . To be sucessful people , I think , 2 more thing are required in addition to trying new things and taking risk .  ` Ambition ' is vital for success . I would like to mention Ichiro Suzuki , the Japanese Major Leage Baseball player at Seattle Marinars in the United States . He is one of the most successful Japanese . As everyone knows he has a incredible talent as a baseball player . He , however , have been having the ambition to be a best baseball player all over the world since he was a primary school . He hoped to be a baseball player and trained very hard . Without ambision , Ichiro Suzuki might be good player only in Japanese .  ` Effort ' is crucial as well . Even though having fantastic dream , people can not get success without the hard training . For instance , I have a dream . I have been thinking to study abroad to expand may value and aquire the skill of Language since I was high school student . Not only the dream `` I wanna study in the US '' but also the effort deserved for it . I have to do what to need . I have to study TOEFL very hard and hard . TOEFL is not easy . The ambition is going to help my motivation for study . But finally the effort brings a result of success .  As is clear from the above , I am on the statement . But I think two mote thing were important to be success . People only doing what they already know how to do well is not challenging . If you get a success , you try new things , take risk , have ambition , and efort	JPN
Most advertisements today are aiming to capture the audience to purchase their products and compete with the other products in the market and so they tend to project their product as an essential purchase for one 's happiness and well being . I personally feel that they make their producta appear much better and useful than they actually are .  Some advertisements inflate the use of their product a little while some others make them appear to create outstanding results or even miracles in one 's life . For example , take any of the aerated drinks ' advertisement . They use prominent sportmen like David Becham or Michael Jordon to endorse their products to show the audience how their drink would enhance one 's performance to become like their idols . Everyone knows that having a drink would'nt make them a star or play like one but just their idols being there in the advertisement maybe persuade them to purchase it . This may work for any purchase not costing much and people may make the small purchase either ways without the advertisement , just the matter of which brand to go for .  Another way by which they make make their products look much better is by persuading people to purchase the product because it will make them look attractive and will influence their personal lives as well . Take the case of all the beaty products which promise to make you look better and attractive by spending a small amount on them . These advertisements may actually get the audiences ' attention because everyone wants to look better by spending the minimal amount of money . These advertisements may particularly catch the attention of teenagers who always are ready to spend on any product that makes them look better in front of their peers .  While some products may rope in big stars to get their point across , some may cash in on the small desires of the audience and ultimately market their product in the best possible way . By and large in most advertisements , overexaggeration of the product is what we witness . The competing products are shown in a light where we feel incomlete without using them .	TEL
Travelling plays a predominent role in the lives of all the middle class families . There are two major issues involved while travelling , one is by travalling along with other people initiated by a tour guide , in other words he is the person lead by a travelling agency . Another issue deals with the people taking their own way to travel to a particular place . According to my view i stongly beleive in going along with a tour guide because , he knows about the cultures and traditions prevailing in that place , he also knows about the history beyond each and every monument present in that place .  As far as the place is concerned there may be dangerous places where their is prohibition for the tourists and without getting initiated by a proper guide , we may fall in to problems by entrying in to that place .  The main reason in going along with a tour guide is that we can know about the place in depth i.e what are the cultures and traditions of the people living in yhat place , and we can really enjoy our journey .  . We can know about the cultures , rituals , symbols of religions an so on . So i think it is better to go along with tour guide .  Another reason i want to make is about the monuments present in the place . When we are moving along with our tour guide we could know about the monument . For example , when we want to visit . '' The statue of liberty at manhatan '' , we have to know the basic purpose or the history beyond statue of liberty . However , without a proper guide also we can the visit the place , but we can not know about the beauty of the place as we are missing the thesis of the place .  In conclusion , the main reason for us going to a particular place is completely fulfilled if , we are accompanied by a tour guide . Moreover , by going to these places we can improve our knowledge about the culture and traditions . As a result we can increase `` International cooperation amomg the people '' and this will lead to a world of peace and gratitude .	TEL
So far as the question is concerned , I am not quite at home with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . Although it may be argued that the young population is not interested with social and political affairs as it was in 1960s. , I believe that young people have willingness to help the communties in which they live .  It is a well-known fact that the young population is aware of the communal issues as they are parts of a family which belongs to the community . In other words , the more they live in family the more they give enough time for their communities . For instance , in a village or in a minority group , the young population do not hesitate to participate in the charity programs such as visiting the hospitals , helping the oldest members of the community . They even became a member of NGOs in order to demand or to help for the communal interests .  On the other hand , we may acknowledge that there are some current problems to keep the youth intact with their community as well as with their families . The process of globalisation suscitates a global village where individuals gain universal attributes and goals rather than interesting with their communities . Therefore , it becomes difficult to keep the interest of the internet-based youth appropriate with that of the communities . However , this situation can not abandon the young willigness to help their communities .  Consequently , we may consider that young people prefer interesting in private and global objectives rather than communal or social ones . Yet , we should not ignore that they are also active in especially helping their communities and they find time to helping even if they feel themselves busy and overloaded by the educational or professionnal life . Briefly , young people nowadays give time to helping their communities in spite of the difficulties in their globalised and internet-based lives .	TUR
young or old .. it 's all about joy  There are differences between the thinking of old and young people due to several reasons , the most important of it is their life style and experience , and their methods to enjoy themseves , as the definitions of enjoying life and how to enjoy life can differ from young people to older people in a huge scale .  as a young woman , i believe that youth enjoy life for the sake of enjoying it and not for the happiness that this joy can result . Young people think that there are many years left in life and we should enjoy it as much as possible before they have serious responsibilities such as career and family . unfortunatly , some times enjoying life for young people means irresponsiblity and careless in life , this is not true for all young people , but many of them interprete it this way .  According to what i mentioned before , i dont agree with the statment that says `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' , as i believe that older people do enjoy life , but in a different way than younger generation would understand , this is due in many reasons like the lack of communication between older and younger generations , and their different difinitions of enjoying life .  For example , i enjoy life by traveling around the world and by meeting new freiends and new contacts , and i always request my mother to do so , but she as an older generation tells me that her biggest joy now is to raise her children well , and to watch them get successful and happy , while years ago she used to enjoy her self differently .  Therefore , i believe that older people enjoy life as much as younger people , and sometimes even more , but the difference is about the thinking of older people , and their experiences after growing wise and mature , which are great things that the younger generation can learn from , and therefore enjoy life more .

In thenty years from now it does n't look possible , in my view , to have fewer cars in used in our societies .  Indeed the car market is very important in countries ' economies . it has been important almost in the past century , but it seems like it 's becoming even more important today . the resaon for this developement is that developing countries , or new developped ones are developing their industries . And it 's well known that one of the major sector of the industry is the car industry .  Therefore more and more cars are getting built every day in the world , and they will be in use in our streets sooner or latter . For example asian countries are becoming very powerfull in this area . We all know brands like Toyota , Honda . .. And if we pay attention to the cars around us we 'll nottice how usual it becomes to see people with those cars .  Besides this developement does n't mean that the other developped countries stopped making cars . They actualy try to catch up with those countries and are making new cars too . For example , we have wolkswagen ans BMW in Germany , chevrolet , general motor in the United-States . .. And much more .  They are all trying to be more competitive so they are all deveoping new cars and saling more cars too .  Cars industry is an important economic area for every country today , that 's why I personaly think that a huge amount of car is coming , and in twenty years it wo n't be solved at all .  But , today we can also see the developement of environementals concerned . More and more organisations are opening in order to protect our planet : Greenpeace was the first one but definately not the last one created .  And in my opinion it 's also becoming a political strategy , so me may have a `` solution '' to this environement damage : a new kind of cars that wo n't polute as much .  for example cars using electricity .  To conclude I would say that economics strategies wo n't let the car industry disapear but they might find new techniques in order to combine strong economy and protection of our environement .	FRE
In the next twenty yearas there will fewer cars than at present . I dont agree with this notionbecause the demand and the importance of the car is ever increasing day by day .  With the advancement in techonology and the statistics produced by the car manufacturers are anything to go by then in the next few years there will be a major incresase in the number of consumers for cars . I think that there could be a increase in the number of cars used depending on the policies issus . I say so becaus e with the ever increasing development in technology there is reduction in prices of the previous models and certain additional featurs are being added int he new cars which would only be a dream a few years earlier . Moreover the notion of a car being a necessity than a luxury thing is changing as even members of not so affluent families or well to do families also own cars . This change could be attributed due to various factors such as easy payment options given by the car manufacturers or the installments given by them . The other reasons could also be that the willingness of the bank authorities to give various loans for the purchase of cars or for the cganges to be made in car . Another reason could be that the company 's exchange offers which say that you can exchange your old car for a new one for an additiona payment which keeps on increasing the sales of the cars .  Plus there are additional benefits of using a car which make it hard to resist object or abandon it . The benefits of the car are you can go with your family whereever you want and at whatever time plus useful in cases of emergency . More than the benefits cars are usually associated with social status . That there is ever an increase for the demand for a new car with certain added features that its precedent is not having . Then there are cars which hold special status as being the royal cars or having your own vintage collection .  Basically you can reach to different destinations according to your own schedule at your own speed . Now-a-days there is a whole lot of variety being offered wherein special additional features are buiklt in it like conference room setting or bedroom setting . With such offers it has lot of benefits for the people who are really busy and cant afford to waste times .  Well with so many benefits its really hard to think that there will be a decline in the number of cars in the near future . With the benefits there are also certain disadvantages like the gas emitted from the exhaust of the cars is polluting the environment and that the fuel used for the functioning of the car is depleting the natural resources . Well for the fact that cars are increasing the air pollution with the development in technology various models are being developed which donot emit any dangerous gases in the atmosphereand for the second disadvantage that they are using the energy resourses new cars are being developed and some have already being developed which use solar energy as fuel or run on electrical energy .  Thus with so many advantages i think the demand for the increase in caras will outnumber its decrease or there wont be any drastic change in the numbe rof cars in the near future . Thus i think that in the near future there will be an additional number of cars than there are today .	TEL
I agree that students should undestand the ideas and concepts than spending time in learning facts . I believe that the human civilization has come to the zenith of technology not because of learing the facts , but by understanding the ideas and concepts .  There have been advancements in many areas . If the humans spend all their time on facts , our lives could have been ended in undestanding the history of our earlier generation . And we could not have seen the progress . There could have been no progress of science . So , applying the concepts of the facts will move the world to the next levels .  I always liked science which make me a scientist not because I know the facts , but the way I undestand ideas and concepts . I am taking a mathamatics call I will use the concepts and idea to get to generate a solution to the problem . If we use fact there will be times , they will not help get the solution .  In our daily life , we live with ideas and concepts . A very besic example , If my parents want me to go buy vegetables form the vegetable market I will decide which way will be easier road . I will analze by asking myself using my concepts and not go with the facts .  Our human mind can take only some facts and then we have to use the concepts to work towards succuss . There are many facts in this world and it will not be in our human abiliites to know all the facts . so it is more important that to know how to apply the concepts and ideas . To deal with the problem .  On a whole , I think that facts can only help to certain level but most importantly it is the ideas and concepts that will hlep us in dealing with daily lives , in our career and also in work .	TEL
It is said that fortune favours the brave . On the same lines , it can be said that success follows people who try new horizons , who extent their limit of vision and dare to take on new challenges in a world that is everchanging . I think that successful people keep trying new things and do not get stuck on any one thing .  The world has seen many industialists who tried different businesses . Though they succeeded on some and failed in others , on a whole they emerged as winners . One bright example that I would like to mention is that of an Indian businessman - Tata . Tata put his first foot in the world of business with an automobile manufacturing unit . He collaborated with foreign companies to provide best available technologies to customers . The business started with trucks but soon flourished to other class of vehicles . Recently , Tata introduced cheapest four wheeler on Indian roads for common man . This journey is amazing . But this is not the only thing that Tata did .  Tata started different businesses apart from automobile . Tea , salt , information technology , telecom - he seems to be ubiquitious . He is also successful in these businesses . Now he is planning to take over world famous brand ` Jaguar ' . Certainly , Tata took great risk when he started every new industry . But great returns demand great risks . A man with vision can handle such risks and emerge out as a winner . These are all qualities of a successful person .  Had Tata been interested only with manufacturing of trucks , he never had had such a great impact on all other business areas . He tried out new things and his efforts paid off . His success surely belongs to the way he conquered new opportunities of business .  Thus , it can surely be said that one who does same thing that he already know how to do well will have less chance to succeed than the one who try different things and takes calculated risks for greater rewards .

For most people to travel is a important part of their lifes , but out there are people which is a little bit risky than others and they enjoy having adventures in their travel . Having a tour gide is the most easy a safe way to travel . Also travel with a guide means to travel on group . With a tour gide you have a schedule to do , and the places where you will go are already planned , also the places to visit will be the most traditional and save places for tourist . While you are traveling in gruop you can not risk neither to get lost in a place that you do not know , the fact of hanging around with many people make the tour funny and gives you the oportunity to meet new friend . In the other hand traveling without a tour guide , for most people , is a way to enjoy a great time with their family . Some people enjoy traveling without a guide because they are not under any schedule neither with a big group . It means that this people do not have any planning place to visit , they just go to the firt place they look . This kind of travel coudl be a little risky because you do not know the place where you are , but it does not matter for them , actually they enjoy it . Traveling is an important part of our life , and it does not matter which one you prefer o which one you enjoy most , but traveling without a tour guide without any schedule neither places planned is a nice experience that everyone should do at least once .

Since World war 2 was ended , Young generation has enjoyed their life more than olders . They , Would-be Baby-boom generation , were good at various entertainment , and were exposed splendid media such as Holly wood movies or Broadway musical shows . There are a few reasons why young people are better at having a great time than older people .  First , young people know well how to play whenever they want eagerly . They know well where is the best bar , what trend is going on , or who is the most famous actor in these days . Of course older people have no time to have a fun in order to get enough money for their family like a daughter who is intersted in an expensive jewelry brand . However young people do n't need too much money because they have no one to be preserved . They just maintain thier living cost that contains money to go the best club in Soho .  Second , young people are healthier than older people because they have young and strong body that older people do n't have . Old people have to pay for their medical cares , medicines in order to maintain the body . In contrast , young people are not needed to get any medical payment at all .  Finally , young people tend to be curious toward all of the strange things what they have never seen before . When older people avoid a stranger from another country , young people try to be closer with positive activity . For example , in a small town , a tourist visit for his/her academical research such as modern agriculture from a strange country , young people or children will try to talk to him/her .  These reasons are why I think that young people are more enjoyable than older people .	KOR
Traveling is very interesting for me , but there is a controversy how to travel ; going alone or in a group . I disagree with this theme and I raise four reasons for this .  First of all , I 'd like to go wherever I can go . It is very useful to go with a tour guide , specially to the place that I 've never been to , because I have little knowledge of dangerous place to visit . But in guide tour , there are something that I do n't want to go to . Also , planning for the place that I want to go is also precious time . ITime to traval is limited , and from planning to travel , it is a starting point !  Secondly , traveling is expanding our eyes . I traveled Brazil a lot and I was capable of knowing foreign people . To know what they do , think and like was an very interesting chance . I like foreigners , including Brazilians , and also want to communicate with foreign people . Traveing is knowing and expanding friends , but this will happen only when going abroad alone , and I would have never had such an experience with travailing by myself .  At last , travailing is a chance of thinking what I am and what I am going to be . In a place where we live , I ca n't be stimulated and there are n't good for my health , but in a new place , I can be fresh in my mind , and I want to know about this .  I know that travaling with a group , for example with friends , family , but it is not interesting largely because I ca n't see , think alone . It is a chance to go , think , enjoy by myself , not for others .  I want to go every year alone travailing wherever I want , and expand my ability .	JPN
Understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students , because it helps to remember processes easily , for exemple . In the subject biology , it is very hard to learn facts without knowing for what the facts are necessary in a biological system or process . In history class it is also important to know about the dates of events . But if you understand the ideas and the development of an event , you can easier put the event in an chronological order .  Learning facts is very important for students who educate a language for exemple . They have to learn vocabularies to improve their new language . Jura students have to learn facts , too , and they have no chance to let that out . Students who study medicine also have to learn a lot of vocabularies for anatomy .  Learning facts about a theme costs a lot of time and is not really helpful in your later work for an enterprise . Understanding ideas and concepts is more likely . It is easier to learn and to understand than facts . Facts are just ficional and you often do not know how to use facts properly in an important situation .  For exemple : If there is a machine which does not work any more , it is very difficult to check every single fact of the machine . It is easier to think about the whole concept of the machine : How does it works and what does it produce ? In this way it is more easier to find the problem of the defective machine .  So , I think , students who want to take a job in an enterprise which is in the trade buisness or in buisnesses with processes , have to know more about ideas and concepts . It is very important to know about the whole work of a process than to know about facts you can easily look up in a book . Understanding ideas and concepts support the ability of thinking about a problem . And the skill to be able of finding a solution for a problem is a skill that makes you desirable for a lot of employees .  In my opinion , it is supportable to declare that understanding ideas and concepts is the most important skill for buisness . And that is what students should learn at their university .	GER
I agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . There are several reasons for supporting this position .  The first reason is that young people have much ability than older people . They can do anything they want to do . Their power is stronger than older people . They hardly get tired . If they dont do things that they want to do until they are young , they can do nothing after getting old . Especially sports like surfin , running , soccer , squba diving , and so on . My hobby is traveling abroad . Taking planes is so tired that I cant endure for a long time . Last winter I went to Orlando , Florida alone . I have to change the plane for two times . Totally , it took thirty hours to get there ! I think order people cant endure no longer .  The second reason is that young people can return soon . When they make a mistake , young people can take other way . But once older people make a mistake , even though such a small mistake , they cant do again . They cant have another chance . For exsample , young people made mistake and they quit their job , they are able to hire another company soon . Because they are young . But older people cant do so . Maybe they are not able to hire a company . Because of their age . '' Too much older ! ''  For these reasons , I agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .	JPN
I agree to the statement according to my experiences and to what I have seen in the past and present and can predict the future solely through my reasoning . The fact that cars bring major pollution , are inefficient , and cars need oil to be used are instrumental that I agree to the proposed statement .  Most importantly , cars have significant detrimental effects to the natural environment around us , and therefore explains that , in the future there will be a decrease in the number of cars . First of all , the exhaust created from cars have polluted the air that we breath , sometimes stimulating diseases to infants , children , adults and many other people . Given that the natural environment is a resource that people all value and desire to protect , makes it clear that cars will be less used when people have seen or will see the dramatic and harmful effect cars have on the Earth 's atmosphere and to overall human health .  On the other hand , cars , in the first place , need oil to be accessed by a consumer , therefore cars would be inefficient in the future . Oil , currently is a very delicate and priceless resource currently at this time of the 21th millenium . Since oil prices are increasing at an alarming rate , people may not have access to oil or petroleum in the near future . Therefore it is obvious that oil is not a natural resource that can be renewed fast enough to sustain its amount when humans are ` over-exploiting ' its resources . As a result , it can be confirmed that at this rate of the consumption of natural gas or oil , how will we be sure that there would be enough resources for cars to run , in the next 20 years ?  Lastly , from the experiences that I have seen is that governments are truly trying to decrease the number of cars for critical reasons . Cars may be convienient to the individual that use it , but it has numberous detrimental effects that governments and the public have to deal with and clean up . Therefore , every year governments use a large percentage of their budget to pay up the car expenses . Expenses such as , pollution , car management , car accidents and many more . Because of such expenses , governments are reinforcing public transportation , such as railways , buses , and subways and is suggested as substitutes for cars because it is much for cost efficient as well as convienient for its users at the sametime .  From my beliefs and opinions I agree to the specified statement , given that cars create major pollution , are inefficient , and costly .	KOR
I agree with the statement that people who achieved success do try new approaches , rather than sticking to the older things which are familiar to them .  For example ancient people were in the impression that earth is a flat surface . Scientist who proved the theory of universe didnot stick to these preformed concepts but rather thought innovatively and achieved success . So new ways and ideas are always essential for the success of a person . They allow us to increase the horizons of our knowledge and perception of facts .  Techonological advances are demanding people to acquire new skills and approaches . Only those people who adapt to these circumstances will flourish in present day compettitive world . To illustrate , suppose a person is well skilled to type on his type machine and is complacent with his skill with no interest in learning computer skills will not meet new expectations of the employer and might loose his job . Moreover , a person who adapts to the new demands and learn computer skills will flourish in his career .  A successful person has the habbit of exploring newways and new things and he tries to put himself in a superior position through his hardwork which is also innovative . If a person sticks to the methods well known to him and refuges to acquire newer skills donot get increments and promotions in his job .  Some people do not dare to risk new changes in their work . But we can never discover anything new without experimenting . So , people should try newthings to improve themselves but that move should be genuine . For example , a wealthy bussiness man who invests all of his wealth in shares might experience a severe loss amd may become a pauper . So I feel that new approches should be definitely encouraged but the person should judge his move rather than hastily implementing his idea . If the person is reasonable in his approach , risks due to new approaches get minimised and he enjoys the fruits of his innovation . So it is not always risky to take up a newthing . Rather we can not acjieve any thing in our life without facing that minimum amount of risk .	TEL
I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is with a tour guide .  Most of the people would not agree with this statement , as they will argue that you can become an explorer if you travel without a tour guide . Well , this can be true if you are travelling alone , travelling with a lot of time on your hands and travelling within your own country .  But imagine if you were to visit a foriegn land , where you do not know any one . You do not know the people , the customs and the traditions . You do not know the historic places and you do not know the directions . How can you enjoy a tour in which you spend most of your time figuring out where to go and how to get there ?  Travelling in a group led by a tour guide has many other benifits , such as meeting the people in your group who share the same interest as yours . You can communicate with them and exchange a lot of valuable information . You can know where they come from and perhaps they can become your tour guides in their country and you can do the same for them .  Tour guides know the exact history of a particular place . They can take you to places which you might not have an access to if you were travelling on your own . Tour guides can also give you hints and tips when it comes to dealing with the locals . They can advice you of the places that you should and should not go .  Most of all , the tour guides give you the best return on your investment . You can go to a foriegn country and make the best use of your time by not missing any of the famous and important places that you could 've missed if you were to travel alone .	ARA
For a centuries , there are many inventions that change our life a lot . One of those inventions is automobile that we use almost everday . Some people consider that car use might decrease little by little , and I agree with this idea . These days , many people , including me , worry about that population might reduce in the future , and because of that , car use might decrease , too . Also , thanks to developing technology , public transportaiton becomes much more convenient now , so this could be one of reasons that people use car less in the future .  Nowadays , many people concern that population might decrease in the future . According to investigation , population rate is focused in elder class people . One of reasons is developed medical technology . Moreover , more women go out to work , recently , they usually refuse to have baby because they will not be able to avoid to quit their work . Because of that , in the future , there might be less population in the world , and car use might be down , too .  As technology develop , public transportation is now much more convenient than when it began . In Korea , there is almost no facilities , such as elevator to support injured people like Japan . However , this year , when I went there , there are many elevators to support those people . Now , still there are many cars in the street , but people might use more public transportation in the future because it is pretty cheap despite of convenience .  As I mentioned , in the future , less people use cars . Of course , still many people use their own car because it is convenient , too . However , less population helps to be down less use of car , and more people will use public transportation , which become more convenient .	KOR
Young people tend to do alot of activities and can perform alot of taskes and desires . In contrast to older people who can have difficulties to having their wishes and desires fulfilled . that is why , young people enjoy life more than older people do .  Physically speacking , older people walked most of the roads in a life time , they are more weary and exhusted from thier trip . Minimal interest in trying new things is obvious on an elderly person . Contradicting young people who have the energy and stamina to preforme taskes , ambition and the lure of the exsotic takes over their minds , trying everything and tasting life in all of its colours , dicovering , learning , felling and performing more missions every day , every moment .  Emotions do have a big effect on a human being . Old people understand that they aged , they know for a fact that their mission in life in almost over , some are sensitive about death and they dont want to loose their families and friends . But , younger people view life as a long trip , a horrizon of advantages they should grasp to sucseed . They have all their life to look forward to .  The metal condition is huge wall to older people . They gradually start to lose their ability to think clearly and remember information , which is a big hussel to them , they know that thier organic computer ( brain ) in starting to disintegrate and deminish but they cant do anything about it . While young people are at their climax of intelligence , new ideas , new information to invent and learn and a future to look forward to . so why should a young person worry about his mental status ?  At the end , young humans are more lively and happy in their lifes , and old people tend to be more sorrow and sad about their current situation . So stay young and happy if you can .	ARA
In this era of immense competition , modern youngsters spend lesser and lesser time towards ` giving back to the society ' . There is a downward trend in the number of hours spent doing community service these days . The sense of belonging has decreased over the years and we tend to take most things for granted . Community service is considered to be ` someone else 's job ' .  Firstly , students are faced with more workload from schools and colleges so they have lesser leisure time . They feel so exhausted after classes that there is little or no motivation to take up some community work . Also , there is high competition , so the students tend to spend after-school hours doing extra research or preparing for tests . Say a student is not doing as well as she expects . In such a case , she will obviously concentrate on making an extra effort and studying harder . Thus community service takes a backseat .  Secondly , when a student does have some time to spare , he or she may have an option to take up a paid job . For example , when a one has an option to make money by working in the local cafetaria and earn a good chunk of money , the community service option does not seem lucrative . This is due to the tendency of seeking personal benefits before caring for others . In other cases , the leisure time is spent ` hanging out ' with friends , watching moveis , going for concerts , chatting on the internet etc . For instance , after a full day at college , two friends prefer to meet up at the mall rather then tire themselves out doing more work .  Usually , the the motivation to do community service arises from a desire to present a more ` attractive ' resume or for college admissions . However , it would be incorrect to generalize this staement because there are a few individuals who genuinly like to do community service out of personal satisfaction . Some people enjoy interacting with elders at old age homes and get happiness when the old express their excitement over having someone to talk to ! Sadly , such youngsters are fewer in number .  Hence , community service is declining these days .	HIN
Many students at some point of their lives wonder if they should choose a specialization in their studies or if they should go into a general university to choose classes in many different fields . I think both can be good , but everything depends on what you want to do .  First of all , I believe that it is important that students do n't specilize too early . In high schools for instance , it is important that students learn about many different fields before being allowed to choose which major they want to study . It can thus make students discover fields of knowledge they did n't know before , but some fields that can also attract them a lot .  Besides , I think that choosing to specialize or not depends on what kind of job you want to do later . Some jobs requiere good knowledge in many academic fields . This is for instance the case of journalism . Some of the journalists do decide to specialize , but the majority are able to write about every topics , whether it concerns a pension reform or a football match .  On a personal point of view , this attitude - to make the choice of not choosing a specialization - can be very interesting . Somebody who decides not to choose a major field of interests will be interested in much more numerous things than somebody only interested in history or philosophy .  But I also think that there is a danger for people knowing lots of things , in many fields . The society also needs specialists who deeply know some aspects of the society . For instance , teaching biology requires to be a specialist in biology . And it is the same for all the teachers . In some countries , teachers are teaching two subjects , but I think it is not such a good idea since they ca n't know very well two fields of knowledge .  To conclude , we can say that societies need both - specialists and people that stay in general knowledge . But personaly , I like having learnt many different subjects before specializing myself . Thanks to this , I discovered what was biology , physics and many other fields that I would not have discovered without my high school classes .	FRE
Advertising has always been a interesting discussion topic for the people . some people think that advertising is not very effective and does not do any wonders . on the other hand , there are also some people who think that advertising really has alot to do . and I think , I would be counted in the second group .  Advertising may make anything better by the a good picturization of that product . the better the picturization , the better would be fascination towards the product . and looks matters alot . for example , we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you . which one would you like to have ? certainly , that looks most appealing to you . is n't it ? that is where advertising comes into the picture . Its magic of advertising .  Advertising enables us to show the good sides of anything . as we all know , that anything in this world is not perfect . all the things have dark sides too . so with a little help of advertisment , we can highlight the positive points of some product and can hide the negative parts .  for an instance , lets take example of cold drinks like , cola , pepsi etc. these drinks are so popular among the people . but the question is why are they ? while we know that these drinks are not good for health . even then they do a great deal of bussiness all over the world . Credit of this should go to the advertising . advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular .  Nowadays , even some schools are providing training for how to do the advertising . these schools considers advertising as an art . and we all know that what art is for . yeah , to increase the beauty of something . and thats what an advertisement does . advertisement increases the worth of the product .  A coin has two faces . now , it is upto us how we are going to show it to the others . Advertising not only tells us how should we present something , but also how to present it with even a better looks . In conclusion , advertisement enhances the worth and beauty of the products . and that make people buy them .	HIN
On the one hand I think young people enjoy life more than older people do . Young people are more active , they can make journeys and sports . They go to parties , spend much time with friends and have not much responsiblities .  Older people often have problems with their health . Some older people need permanent medical and are not able to leave their home . Furthermore they know the most of their life is over . I think this is not an amusing thought . So one can say many older people have not the possibilities to enjoy life , but there are also older people who do not want to enjoy life . I know some older people who are healthy and well-off but nevertheless they do not go out , but sit in their hous and are sad .  On the other hand young people are just at the beginning of their lives and therefore they have to fight for their place in society . This struggle is not only fun , too . In school they have to work hard , because they want to rise their job opportunities and in university this situation is continued . When young people have leisure time , many of them waste their time in order to play vidoe games at the computer . Other young people are unsatisfied by society and lead life as outcasts . In contrast to that there are many healthy older people who earn a comfortable income or are even retired . They often afford luxurious trips and they have not so much pressure to be succesful . Instead of stress in school , in university or at the beginning of a career , older people can play with their grandchildren or can go for a walk with other older persons . I think this is a great perspective .  Older people can look back and see what they have achieved over the years . That can also be great pleasure . Resuming all that reasons , I think both young and older people can enjoy life , but I am convinced that older people more often do so .	GER
Does most advertisements make products seem much better than they reallly are ? Recently this issue has been brought into focus and aroused a fierce public debate . Many people hold the opinion that it is due to the corlorful advertisements the products looks much better than they really are , while the opinion is strongly opposed by numerous people who believe that all the advertisements show the reality to the costomers . However , as far as I am concerned , I agree with the former which is most advertisements in our daily life making products seem better than they really are .  To begin with , from my point of view , damaging our health is among the drawbacks of advertisements making products look better than they really are . For instance , in order to get more profits , many medical merchants cheat the consumers by advertising their drugs extraggrately . By using this method , the merchants are likely to become rich , however , many costomers who have perchased the medicine may be facing with some healthy problems the bad medicine brings about . That is why I said some advertisements make products seem better than they really are .  On the other hand , considerable though the benifits that advertisements results in are , they can not compete with the drawbacks that the advertisements making products seem much better than they really are brings about , if economic issues have been taken into deliberation . For example , a number of merchants use advertisements to make their products look better in order to make more money , while the costomers do not realise the fact so they often spend large sums of money to buy a worthless product . After a period of time , they finally find out they are cheated . The example tell us that the impacts that ads has on our economicis life is huge .  In conclusion , there may be some elements of truth in the thoughts of some people that advertisements do not make the products seem much better than they really are . However , in my mind , most advertisements which make products seem better than they really are really affect many people 's health and processions . In order to enjoy a healthier and happier life , some measures must be taken to manage the advertise industry to make advertisements tell the truth to the massive costomers .	CHI
In a leaning process , the aim should be well defined in order to get closer to the target , being awarness of where to reach and what to get . To me this is a must for the learning process . I strongly belive that we need to differenciate the conceps , ideas and facts . To me students need to learn what is necessart yo analyse and differenciate the facts and results . . To analyse the facts and results they need to learn ideas and conceps ; ok , why ?  First of all ideas and conceps are the main resources of the behaviours , inventions , expressing emotions and etc . So to make connection with results we need to consider idaes and concepts that based on . To me students will learn both of them , unporved concepts or ideas can turn to facts tomorrow .. But also learning facts is necessary to anaylse the root af facts . What are the resources of the facts ?  As a second students need to learn the methodology of comparing conceps and facts . This help students to anylse the facts and also make easy to learn . In the learning process as an additional thing we can put to learn how to make comparison .  Further more while determing the aims of learning ; it should be to learn facts but being aware of ideas and conceps . . It is like learning three situation of matter , but now scientis proved that there is one more sitiation of the matter . So being aware of conceps is helpful ' it is like not to close our eyes from what others thinking .  As a consequence stundents should have an idea that why they need to learn , and how ? and they need to learn make connection and comparison with facts and conceps while learning . .. l belive that learning conceps is not harmfull and wasting of time and also learing just learning facts is like closing our eyes to the other . Students need to learn both and make comparison of facts and ideas while learning .	TUR
I agree with this idea .  There is four reasons .  At first , it is more appropriate to play sports because some of the hard sports such kind of succer , basketball and baseball , it is difficult to play for older people . In fact , there are only young star player in professional league of above sports . In addition , It is not only the number of sports they can do but also the risk of injuly when they play the sports . The possility to get injuly is higher in older people case .  Secondly , young people can travel easilly than older people especially foreign country case . When we trip to somewhere , we sometimes face culture difference with other peoples who live in that place and should have flexible mind to accept such kind of culture difference to have good relationship with them . Moreover , sometimes it is necessary to communicate with them by their own language . In that case , we have to learn another language to communicate . It is easier for young people to learn because of the flexible and fresh thinking way .  Thirdly , young people have enough time to do what they would like to realize . Basically older people have more social responsibility especially they have sons or daughters . It is quite difficult to make timing to do in quite tight situation of older people .  Forthly , there are a lot of chances for young people to change situation according to their preferance . For example , it is easy to get new job for young people rather than older people because they have a lot of potential to learn more about new job . Main reason is they can work more time due to law . Currently it is difficult to have jobs for over 60 . Some of the people who would like to work can not get jobs because of there reasons . In young people case , it fully depends on themselves .	JPN
I myself am considered a young person and live in a community compromising of both young and old . It is a common perception that young people enjoy themselves more than older people do . However , I think this perception is faulty . In fact it is the older generation who enjoy life more .  Youth has many advantages . It is perceived that young people enjoy more because they have more energy , enthusiasm and time . However , what they do not account is the society and its demands . With time our society has been evolving , It has become more demanding , more particular and much younger , Even though the younger generation does have more energy , enthusiasm etc. etc. it does not have then TIME to enjoy .  `` I wish the week had eight days '' - this is a common phrase heard from all young people across the globe . Younsters are pushing themselves to become responsible and successful citizens everday . They are always wanting to do more in less time . Their life has peer pressure , study pressure , exam pressure , job pressure , personal pressure . Added to this are various family , friends and other social obligations . There is too much to achieve in such less time . Thus the attributes which should have assisted them in enjoying life more become reason for them to work and achieve more . Time is always short . In this rush of things when does one get time to even breathe ?  In contrast , the older generation is at a stage where they have undergone all pschylogical , communal , religious , physical metamorphisis . Thanks to various state and public policies they are no longer financially dependant in old age . Thus they are free to experince life as it is . Though they lack in the attributes favouring the younger generation they compensate by maturity , patience and motivation to truly enjoy life .  It is commonly said `` Life begins at Sixty '' . This is true , because by this age one is free of all responsiblities and obligation and can enjoy life at their own pace . There is true enjoyment only when one has TIME to experience every minute particle .	HIN
In seeing how the total consumption of gas is consequent nowadays and regarding the fact that it will increase with the rise of China 's consumption , the car issue must be debated . However more the disparition of the use of car , I think an evolution of them is going to happen .  Even if the gas issue may raises questions about slowing the use of cars for different reasons - for instance because it entails environnemental problems such as the ozone layer depletion , and also because while ressources are decreasing the gas consumption is still rising - in my opinion it wo n't happen .  Indeed cars are a fundamental part of civilians everyday life , it has been one the most sold item since the 1950 's . Today in most cases it has become very difficult to live without a car when you are not living in a very big city . Although prices are lowering , the other ways of travelling are still much more expansive than car . For instance most of the population who can afford it is going to work driving a car . It is true that other ways of travelling have been enhanced in cities such as the underground or buses , however car remains the easier and more common way to travel .  Nevetheless , I think there will be some change but concerning how cars work . Today some people are already working on how make car pollute less through fostering research on other type of fuels made from plants for instance .  To conclude we can say that changes are obviously needed but as far as I am concerned I think it will not be a decrease of the use of cars but an evolution of car themselves .	FRE
I think that in order to be successful one has to try new things , and be bold , creative and innovative .  If we do not do that to some degree , we are only repeating what many other people are already doing , and eventually we can become obsolete or irrelevant .  As an example I can contrast the story of Apple and IBM in the personal computer business .  They started at about the same time , both with very innovative products , the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC . During the years , though , Apple kept innovating the design and the software of his products so that they have always been cutting-edge , unique , even cool and trendy . IBM on the other hand thought they could bank on their dominant position in the market for mainframe computers for large businesses . They assumed that their established customers for IBM mainframes would have bought also IBM personal computers , and so they did not make an effort to keep innvovating their design and their software because they thought business clients did not require that .  As a result IBM lost competitiveness and market share when other companies started to make cheap `` clones '' or copies of the IBM personal computes that were more technologically advanced and better looking than their IBM counterparts .  By keeping doing what they tought they were able to do well , IBM ended up selling the personal computer business entirely , after it became vastly unprofitable .  On the other hand , Apple has acquired a large niche market for their Mac computers thanks to thier continuous innovation . Not only that : Apple has taken substatial risks to diversify its product offering by inventing new produtcs altogether , such as the iPod and the iPhone , most of whom have been hugely successful .  Finally , Apple has even taken the ultimate risk to change their own name from `` Apple Computer '' to just `` Apple '' , to signify their shift from just the computer manufacturing business to the entertainment business . Today Apple sells not just compuetrs , but also consumer electronics such as the iPod and iPhone , and other products and services , such as music downloads .  This shows how being innovative and willing to take risks can lead to sustained success over time , and on the other hand how replicating our old ways can	ITA
I fundamentally agree with the statement that many advertisements make products seem better than they really are . However , we should not ignore the the benefits of the advertisements for this reason .  To begin with , I admit that most advertisement do some exagerations on the products . It is also the reason why the manufactures are so fascinated in making advertisements . The ads arouse our interests by demonstrating how excellent the products are . For example , we can always see the ads for hair cleaning products on TV . Some models or famous starts come out to show their extremely shiny and smooth hair , and they tell us the special product is the reason for their beautiful hair . It is really attractive . But when we buy the product from the market and use them , we will find that the result is not as good as the they claim in the ad . From this aspect , we are cheated by the ads .  However , the various advertisements play significant roles in our life . On the one hand , we can receive some introductions and suggestions from them . Imagine when we are shopping in the super market , we must to face thousands of brands . There even would be hundreds kinds of soft drinks . If we know nothing about the products , we must spend lot amounts of time on selection . With different ads , situations change . We must be aware of several brands of the soft drinks , then we can choose from these small range . On the other hand , advertisement has became a big industry . Both the customers and the manufactures need the ads firms . And these firms supply large number of job opportunities for our society every year . Therefore , the advertisements are necessary for us .  Last but not least , the qualities and services determine the products ' fates ultimately , not the ads . We customers may be cheated once , but not always . Besides , not every product is bad . The famous and lasting brands in most fields are good enough for the customers , in fact . As this reason , I think it is acceptable when some advertisements exagerate the benefits of the products .  Based on the above reasons , I believe that advertisements would serve good functions to our society , although they sometimes make the products seem better than they really are .	CHI
Cars are one of our major transport items in modern life . We have been using them for more than 50 years but it 's hard to tell what their approximate numbers will be in twenty years time period as this subject needs a large analysis . But some predictions comparing their advantages and disadvantages can be made .  Number of cars in use can increase or stay nearly the same in twenty years . First of all , they are not new technologies so that they became crucial elements of our lives . For inctance , we have built large roads , bridges or traffic rules to use them effectively and even some of us regard their cars as their friends . What is more , although they pollute the environment it could n't prevent people from using them . Secondly , they still provide easy access to everywhere comparing to planes or trains . For instance , we will still be using our cars to go near distances . In addition , there can be new materials in twenty years time , which will be alternative to petrol and which will enhance the car usage .  On the other hand , it 's also possible to say that number of cars in use will lessen in following years . New transport opportunities can be mentioned to support this argument . For instance , much accessible and much more efficient vehicles can be preferred in the future . Moreover , cars use petrol which is a natural resource that wil be finished soon and for which people are being killed for years , So it 's logical to think that people are already fed up with problems that petrol cause . Not only its political and social problems , but also petrol and cars have an economical aspect due to the fact that petrol prices have been on increase and became very expensive .  In conclusion , it 's possible for cars to be popular in following years as they are up to now . But in my opinion , the backdraws of these little vehicles are so many that , people will find new options in twenty years . Besides , none of us wants to face wars or high prices any more .	TUR
I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following two reasons .  First , I think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are in order to attract many people . For example , I think upon the advertisement of Nintendo DS , which is the portable video game machine sold by Nintendo , Japanse famous company of video games . At the TV commertical , Fujisaki Nanako , who is one of the most famous actress in Japan , seems to enjoy playing it . Then , last year I bought it . At first , it is interesting for me . By contrast , within three days , I became boring . Now my Nintendo DS put on the bottom of the box . Nintendo DS is not attracted for me . This example illustrates that in order to attract many people advertisements try to show that products are better than they really are .  Second , many people agree with the situation that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . For example , when I was a student at Kyoto University , which is one of the most famous college in Japan , I took a brand strategie class , in which we thoght how to make the brand image of the company through case studies . When professor Okada , who was my teacher at the class , discussed about an advertisement of car . In the class discussion , Okaie , who was the best student in my class , stated that in the TV commercial , such as Toyota and Nissan , the car run along the very beautiful road which we had never seen . He mentioned that this situation was only brand strategie and everyone knew that there was not such a beautiful road in Japan . Every student agreed with his opinion . At that time I understood that advertisements made products seem much better than they really were .  Therefore , I definitely agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	JPN
I disagree with stateman that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities becouse the young spend many of his or her time to help the person that have some disabilities and also help the older people , for this reasons the statement is wrong . An example is if a young have a grandparents such as grandfather or grandmother when he help them he make an help for the communities becouse they spend a time to help an older person to buy food , water , medicine and other and has also spend time to speack with them that in some cases is more important than when a person go to them only for take a list of what they necessity .  This is the same aspect that there is when a young help a person with disabilities becouse the true problems is n't his inability to do something but is the necessity to speack and play with other persons same to him or her and this persons is the young .  I know a lot of young people that over the time that he spend for him also spend a little or a large of the time that remain to him to help this persons and this is very important for the communities and the people that do this .

Does success come to you or do you come to success ? Would doing only what you are used to do be proficient to take it to another level ? The key to success often comes with a certain risk involved .  Observing successful people you often find a pattern that those people are open to new ideas , will go new ways and broaden their vision continously . The are not shy to take risks , and thus help progress to be made .  If one only did what he used to be doing for years , his vision would narrow and his success be steady . Many people succeed not in doing the same year in , year out , but in breaking out of their usual work pattern . Certainly , this very step involves a lot of risk . If you fail , you might lose your job . If you invest lots of money , it might be lost . If your are working with hazardous materials , you might risk your health or even your life . But technical progress hardly would have been made if it was not for people who risked their lives in order to find ways to improve airplanes , cars or machinery .  If no one dared to award Larry Page and Sergej Brin with two million dollars in 1998 , Google would not have revolutionized the internet . Now , it paid off a millionfold .  Risks have to be taken , and people need to be open to new ideas to develop them further , to try them out and to eventually decide whether they are worth it or not in , order to gaining a competitive advantage over their rivals .  Nothing is secure , and nothing is to be gained if we just stuck with what we know , and only in very rare cases success and development comes to us . In most cases , we have to work hard for it , never knowing whether it will pay of .  One of the best examples might be stock brokering . Is he most successful who always went for the safe bets ? Generally , the highest revenues are made through investing in the more risky stocks . And only those who are open to take the risk will succeed long-term in this market .  Being open to new things and daring to take risks brings you further than just go with the normal daily routine .	GER
I disagree with this statement . First , we can approuve this kind of opinions because we often heard about successful people whose success was a response to an new idea . For instance , people who develop the chain-work in the industry of automobile used to take a lot of risks . They did n't know if the demand was big enough to develop this kind of mass production , but they choose to take the risk and they were successful . That 's why the statement we discuss is not totaly wrong , but I think that it 's not true .  My point is that I think that trying new things and taking risks are two of the keys factors to be successful , but are not caracteristics of successful people . There are other factors to run well a business , like good opportunities . Sometimes , you have a real good opportunitie and you choose to try , and that 's the key of your success . Moreover , there are a lot of successful people who had a good idea at the beginnig , but who do n't take new risks for years . For instance , Bill Gates is a realy successful person , but he does n't take risks nor than he tries new things . He had develop the most famous firm in computer engineering , but he did n't try to diversify his activities .  Moreover , a lot of successful people based their success in a very particular fields . They choose to become the best in what they do , and they do n't want to change their image by trying new activities . So , they do n't try new things , they do n't take risks but they are successful because they know exactly how to do well what they do . This is exactly the opposite of the statement we have to discuss . And I do n't think it 's wrong .  To conclude , I think that there are not only one way to act when you are successful , and that 's why it 's really difficult to run a successful business . Every successful business manager is different , and take different decision than an other manager in a same situation .	FRE
There are many ways one can travel . people can travel alone or in group led by a tour guide or travel in groups without a tour guide . i do prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . Because with the help of a tour guide we can save time , save money and get the effective use of their rich knowledge about the places .  i prefer to travel in a tour led by a tour guide . Because they will have experiences in planning and arranging tours . By this way we do n't need to scratch our head to plan the tour . For example , one our family planned to visit singopore . In singapore , we missed many important places to visit . This is because we had less knowledge about the place and language . We would not have faced this problem if we had hired a tour guide .  With the help of a tour guide , we can complete our tour with less cost . because they will have a complete data base of hotels , travels , lodges and other important things around the world . They can find effective tour plan that will fit into our budget . For example , one of my friend who also visited the singapore with his family with a tour guide completed the tour with inly 10000 dollars . but in our trip i spent more that 15000 dollars . so i think a good tour guide will help us in saving money .  By hiring a tour guide we can save time during the tour . because they can plan us some good schedule so that we will visit maxium places in the limited time . Also , by choosing a good and experienced guide we can get to know the historical facts behind the place or city .  Though we will get a overhead of paying to the guide , i think its more worth than the amount we pay them . So i think considering all the important facts mentioned above , its better to hire a tour guide when we are going to travel in group .	HIN
The community associations are formed in order to serve their community , to make it develop . As the engines need petroleum products to work ; the community needs young people 's attention to be strong and well-organized . However , because of the education that young people have , the way of living that the others , with whom the young people live with , the daily events , which make the young people think pessimistic , young people do not pay enough attention to their communities as they do before .  Firstly , education , that we have during our lives , has really important effects on people 's way of living . It can be easily seen that , well-educated people are caring their community more than the other people , who are not well-educated . For example , think of somebody who graduated from university . The person , we are talking about , has a knowledge of things that a community needs and can give a decision about what to do for the community .  Secondly , young people can get easily affected from the people they are living with . Is not it right that young people want to be like their parents ? Nor , their parents do care about the community that they live in , neither the young people are the small versions of parents .  These are not all the factors that can affect young people in a bad way like this . Has anybody ever thought the idea of daily events can affect young people in a bad way ? For instance , think about the topic of war , occuring in the middle eastern countries . This can be told as one of the reasons that young people are pessimistic about the future and their community .  Finally , from my standpoint it is true that young people do not give enough time to their communities . I do strongly believe the thing this can be so	TUR
Some people like to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects while others prefere to stick with one subject and do the best they can improve what they learn . Personally i prefer to specialize in one subject for many reasons i will explain in this essay .  First of all , Consentrating on one subject makes you a professional and knowledgable in that subject . Also when you give as mach of your time as you can , you will be very successful . It is better to stick with one subject than being confused with many subjects which will you forget in the future .  Secondly , it is a quiet challenging when you specialize in one subject . For example , when pick one academic subject and study it for you whole life and get an advaced degree , your life is going to be better and your children will get better education . Talking about myself , now i am thirty-three years old and i am still studying and trying to get my masters degree in engineering . I picked that subject when i was in highschool and still is in mind and do whatever it takes to finish what i started and it is like challenging myself .  Finally , i would like to say that picking one subject is much better than having more subjects which very complicated for me . Specializing in one subject is even challenging yourself or others , and also you should put your mind in thing to be successful in life and be better educated .	ARA
In my view , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I do not prefer to travel alone as i believe that when you travel with friends then you can take atmost pleasure and information of the travel as there will be many question for the tour guide as there will be many brains , not one . I just want to emphasise this by using an example of my travel with my friends .  I am a history student by profession . In the last year of my college I had a thesis to be submitted on a Great monument , Taj Mahal . It was a tour where a group of 4 ( including me ) have gone and the place was to New Delhi , in India where Taj Mahal is located . It is one of the ancient cities in India with great history and also the capital of the country . There we hired a tour guide , who is believed be the best in the place . While looking at the monument and hearing to the information from the guide , we were astonished about the history , beauty and the efforts required for its construction . There were lot of area in the monuments whose named were not even heard by us before i.e. none of the books contained these details , which are very important for our observations and thesis . There are lot of question that were asked by our group to the guide . I think my share of questions would be only one tenth of the total . Then , I realised the importance of traveling together . I felt that if I have come to the place alone then i would have learnt only one tenth of the information for the thesis which would have reduced my scores . After coming back from New Delhi to our place we have check our share of expenditures for the travel and it was only 40 % when compared to expenditures if one one travels else .  With the above mentioned example , I believe that travelling in group with a tour guide not only helps in getting more information about the place you visit , but also helps in reducing your expenditure for the travel . It reinforces your relation with your friends . You will remember and recollect your experiences and incidents in the travel through out you life .	TEL
`` Half knowledge is always more harmfull then not getting it at all . '' It is always important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning from the facts . however one can always support ideas with the facts and figures of day today life . For a student the more knowledge one gets , the more beneficial it is .  If everyone will start practicing learning through facts then there wo n't be any room for the reserch to take place and people will stop showing interest towards the innovation and new things . for example the fact is that a school bus fetch kids from school to home whereas the idea and concept behind is to make their journey more comfortable , safe and enjoyable .  Understanding a subject in the depth is the basis of getting knowledge about it . its always good to support your idea with a fact but if the knowledge is totally based on the fact , then one has to make sure that it is complete and accurate when my mother inlaw got admitted to the hospital every one knew that he has gone through a massive heart attack and the underline fact that everyone was stating was that she is old enough to survive . Me and my husband were more interested in knowing that how to take better care of her so that she should not have much complications afterwards , so the doctor took time out to explain us that how heart works in a human body . The impact of fat rich diet on blood vessels and heart and which may lead to the process of atherosclerosis , how heart has to do more work . after getting the concept cleared on the same , i think both of us are in a better position to take care of her and to discuss this topic with her and our family .  I strongly feel that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts and its always advantageous to learn facts about the same so a combination of both is important	HIN
I think that trying new thing and taking risks is not necessarily of condition to be successfull but that it is a condition to get out of mass . I think people doing good work should be recognised for it and have success in their carrer even if ther do n't do anything new . I know a small shop where the man repair shows and bags . The man is doing very good work at a very reasonable price . It is nothing special but the quality of it < s wor is known in the town and he always have clients . However , the man is neither very rich or very famous . If this is the kind of success one target , then I think the person must absolutely try new things and take risks to distinguish from the other peoples . Among the peoples we remember the more are the inventors and discoverers . They often try a lot of things before doing the iinvention that made the famous .	FRE
Education is the cornerstone in our society , It 's the main path that leads a person into the large , endless world of knowledge . Knowledge can be broad , as well as narrow . But which one is better to have ?  To be able to answer this question properly , this topic will be divided into two parts : the undergraduate and the graduate students .  The undergradutate students will take a diversity of courses . This will provide them with a large opportunity that allows them to choose in which field to go later on .  For example , in the first two years of the pre-pharmacy degree , we used to take , for instance , cultural study courses , arts courses , which are not related to pharmacy . And many students shifted their major after taking these courses . They found themselves brilliant in other fields . This diversity in courses , gave them the chance to choose the major that suits them the best . Imagine that the students take only major pharmacy courses from the first year . This could lead to the failure of many students , because they were not given the chance to study other courses . It 's a serious situation , especially in the academic majors that are related to the public health and safety , such as medicine , pharmacy , engineering , etc . ..  However , the graduate students do n't have this problem . They decided to go through a specific field , after taking this diversity of courses , when they used to be undergraduate students .  So , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not last forever . And it 's a complementary of the narrow knowledge .	ARA
I 'm agree with the affirmation that says : young people enjoy life more than older people do . I have twentythree years old therfore i am a young boy , in this period my life is very enjoy and for this i am happy . In this last years I have done some things , many of this was very important for my growth , many of this was very enjoy , but at the other hand there was some bad moments . Moreover I can say that in my life the good period are more present than bad period .  I 'm young and this thing is very beautiful , in this period of my life i can do some enjoyed things , for examples yestarday i played with my friend at football , in other days I had played at baseball , cricket , basketball . .  Young old let me do this thing , becouse my body is ok , I do n't have problem , I 'm healtly . At the moment i think that i can do everything ! it 's a good sensation , the best i have never had .  At the other hand this good period ca n't continue for all my life , in this case i could is an highlander ! There is a period of our life that all things is more difficult than in youth . This difficult period is when the people come to be an older person . This is the ultimated state of our life , when our body come to be ill , old . ..  I think that there are some good moment in this sad period , the close contact with our relative develops one strong rapport , is important , in this manner we can be more happy than only .  In conclusion I think that young people are more enjoy than the older , but we must love our life , becouse in unique and indispensable .	ITA
I believe that marketing and advertisement have started to play an interesting role in our lives . The number of products available in the market today is increasing very fast , and therefore manufacturers are racing with each other to make their brand names and products known to people . The question is why does a possible customer remember one product , on the other hand forgets the other ? The answer to this question is trivial , somehow the possible customer is convinced that ( this can also be on the subconscious level ) one of the products is better than the other , and therefore remembered only the better one . This gives advertisers all around the world motivation to show the products better than they are , because they need to show that that particular product is the best .  The first proof of this can be found in advertisements that present a setting that is not or can not be real . This could be a beach so amazing that it can only be a painting , or a photograph modified using software . I think that the setting is the key to making people believe that what you are offering is something better than they have , because it is being displayed in an environment that is better than yours . Another example of this might be the people in the advertisements , most of the women in it are very beautiful and most of the men in it are very handsome . What an advertiser is trying to achieve by using nearly flawless characters is to convince us that we can be like them , all we need to do is to buy that new cellular phone .  The worst case is of course when an advertiser claims that a product can do something that it can not in the average . Most of the advertisements only give information about the best cases , an extreme example could be that how a tooth paste made somone 's teeth as white as pearls from the ocean , in a clinical experiment . During the time interval , this information is being transmitted to our brains , a fast subtitle written in a tiny font size indicates that in this experiment some kind of chemical was also used to amplify the effects of the mentioned tooth paste .  This situation will continue to become a bigger problem as long as new products are introduced to the global and local markets everyday , because this will increase the motivation for advertisers to do so .

I agree with the passage that states that successful people try new things and take risks .  It is good for people to do what they know how to do well , and probably they will succeed on that topic but if they only focus on that , they wo n't be as succesful as they would have been by trying different things and taking risks .  I believe that the more new things we try , the more we learn , and therefore , the more chances we have to feel that we made it to our goal , which I think is what defines sucess in life .  But of course the risk should not be any type of risk , for example , opening a new business like the restaurant , would be a risk for people that do not have the expertise on that type of business but if they ask for advice from experts on that area and make a sound judgement of the possibilities of that particular business , it is good to take the risk .  Another example of a type of risks that people can take in order to reach sucess , is taking the chance to apply to a University to get a degree . Some people think that they will be rejected and because of that they just keep in the same possition that they are at that moment , maybe because they have a fear of failure . If they do not work hard to get what they want and do not risk the possibility of feeling rejected , it is something that , I believe , will affect them in the future when they think about the things they have done in their pastw and did not do it . That wo n't make the person feel sucesssful .  For all these reasons , I believe that sucessful people should take risks and learn to do new things in life .	SPA
I agree to the author 's opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . The present generation faces various challenges , works with too many responsibilities in a world of immense competition . They hardly have ample time to help their communities .  Man 's life today has changed tremendously with the advancement in science and technology . The more the changes over the years , the higher their aims have become , the greater the responsibilities to be carried out and the greater are the accomplishments to be made . His needs have changed tremendously with advancement in technology and science . This change has not made his life easier but also challenging to succeed .  Man irrespective of his age is working harder than what he was doing a 20 years back . If we cosider a small kid , he too is busy with his academic schedule with a change in his syllabus , amount of material to be studied . He hardly finds time for his co-curricular activities . If a teenager is considered , he is busy making a career for himself . A middle aged man is quite occupied in improving his skills or standards of living . Its only a retired person who seemingly has time for activities but lacks enough energy .  The change in technology over the past few years has brought a change not only in man 's life making things easier for him but also in his way of thinking . Today even a small kid thinks about what advantages he can get for sacrificing something . Every individual is more focussed on what he or she can become , how much can he or she earn and how to make more profits . They lead a very mechanical life where they mainly believe in the famous saying `` Time is Money '' .  They would not like to spend their time on something that doesnot benefit them in terms of money or luxury . As considered in management science theory that man 's social needs come only after his financial needs .  In such a society people hardly think about their communities and take out some time to help their communities . Therfore the author 's opinion about the young people not havin time to help their communities is very much agreeable .	TEL
There are now numerous advertisements in television , magazine or newspaper which describe products they made . Also , they attracts consumers and makes them buy their products by advertising . However , there is a problem with most advertisements . It is that the real products are often worse than products shown in advertisements . Advertisements often fake consumers by hiring famous actors and hiding bad characteristics that involved .  With such a famous actor , companies could make a lot of money in advertisements . Suppose that certain company hired Bread Pitt . In that advertisement , Bread Pitt uses a new after - shaving lotion that company has made . Then , consumers think that company 's after shaving lotion has great quality because well-known actor use it . In addition , people believe that if they buy that product , they could be like famous actor or they could follow actor 's fashion at least . Unfortunately , the products are not that great as people expected . Although well-known actors use it , it does not mean that their products are well-made .  Obviously , companies often highlight the good characterstics involved in their products but they often hide the bad things in advertisements . There are a lot of reasearch which are done by undergraduate students related to this topic . They finally found that even though companies should inform all characteristics by law , they often make bad characteristics invisible . Companies usually put the negative information under their products so that consumers can not see it . People often see the highlighted words such as `` This product is free from pesticides or This product is the first invention in the whole World , '' Truly , there are some people who say that making great advertisements is obligatory for companies who want to earn lots of money . However , they went too far . Companies should think the consumers ' right . They have their rights to buy what they want and based on information that adverstisements gave .	KOR
Older people usually consider young people of our generation as more lazy and more self-centered than young people of their own generation . Eventhough the origin of this belief is easy to understand in individualistic countries , I find it difficult to accept the idea that people nowadays do n't give enought time to helping their communities .  Indeed , I think that modern societies offer more structures and organisations to allow people to help the community indirectly . For instance , systems such as the social security system in France allow workers to help indirectly the people needing health care by paying taxes . If this idea do not seem to apply directly to young people , once again we can argue that young people are indirectly helping their communities . For instance , when they spend time working for school in order to get the needed skills to eventually find a job and contribute to the wealth of the country .  Some people would argue on the other hand that governements of modern societies do not offer enought to the people who still need individual help , not only in term of money , but mostly in term of time . An example could be the lack of volontiers for the care of retiered people needing personnal help . If one approach consists in blaming the people having free time , like the young people , for their selfishness , and alternative attitute can be to look at who helps , and who does n't help to change the situation . Modern societies probably reached this point of no-return where people got used to rely on the governement for social issues . Therefore its seem reasonnable to give more credits to the people who actually act on the governement - by the power of voting , by protesting , or taking part in the political life - so that social issues become a major concern .  As a conclusion , they are different way of helping a comminity , and we can find , depending on the culture or the country , specific groups of young people who actually give time to make something usefull , either by working hard at school , or by voting .

It needs people like Benjamin Franklin , who was risking his own life for the sake of science , when he used a parachute during a thunderstorm to study the characteristics of electricity , in order to enhance our technological but also philosophical understanding . There are countless examples of man in history who risked there own wealth or even there life to try out a ` new thing ' in which they believed and put their faith .  It is inherent to the human nature to strive for new knowledge and wisdom . But new knowlegde can only be gained by daring the step aside of the enlighted path and search in the darkness . Risk has to be accepted as a part of this search .  To become successful you need to distinguish yourself from the crowd and this also means to accept some risk . One possibilty to do so is by exploring new ways and , thereby , invent something new or develop new skills . Successful entrepreneurs , for example , are usually recognised as risk-taking people . Innovation is the result of their effort to become better and make things better . With their success the shape our economy and our society . It is people like Bill Gates who changed the world we are living in today ; and he started in a small Garage , working on something people at that time might have called ` crazy ' and ` useless ' . He definetely tried a ` new thing ' and that is wad made him very successful .  Another proof that success and risk-taking go together can be provided by the financial markets . It is taking the risk which pays off . But that does not necessarily mean that risk is uncontrollable . Information can be gained and used through personal effort to assess the quality of the risk . So to become successful it is also necessary to get informed , implying that one can not only do what he knows how to do well already but has to try ` new things ' .  Acknowledging this , I have to agree with the given statement .	GER
I read , I forget . I learn , I still forget . I understand , I remember . This translation of a Chinese proverb says it all . A strong and sturdy base is mandatory for every building to stand tall . An understanding of things is like a base to a human being in the building of his life .  It is obviously more important to understand things that it is to learn facts about them . It is this understanding of a particular topic or a phenomenon which encourages an individual to analyse things occuring around him or her . This can be clarified better as we take a look at the following examples :  For instance , we consider the example of an electrical engineer . He has learnt from the book facts about domestic power supply . But he has not understood how the process of delivering power is taking place . In case of an emergency , if he is required to tackle some power problem , he would n't be able to repair it , or trying to troubleshoot it might even prove fatal to him , if he does not have an understanding of the fundamental .  Considering the example of swimming would not be difficult . If a person has learnt the Archimedes ' principle of buoyancy , it obviously would not help him swim . But it would only be possible if a person understands how to swim under proper guidance .  All the research experts and scientists around the globe are responsible for new innovations not because they have mugged up facts and figures relating to their area , but because they have created their own facts and laws using their understanding of the subject .  Considering the above examples and illustrations it can be very well said that - It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . For only this would bring them up as better individuals and better thinkers who would help in development of their country	HIN
The reasons of success are multiple . On one hand , many people think that to be successful we need to find new solutions , anticipate new trends and by the way take risks . On the other hand , people tend to think that experience prevails and that the best way to succeed is to focus on and master what you are already able to do . In my opinion , success is directly linked to the risks you are able to take .  In the business world , one of the most usual word to explain the success of a company is `` innovation '' . Nowadays , clients or shareholders are attrated by companies which take risks by offering really new products . The world is moving and changing , the company which will survive is the company which is able to aniticipate new social or economic trends . For example , easyJet is very successful because this firm understood and analysed the trends of `` low-cost '' before anyone else . It was risky compared to the traditional and expensive offer . But finally , easyJet or RyanAir are the most popular .  Indeed , it is quite important to focus on one speciality to be the best in what we do . Nonetheless , people who give the priority to experience are more static in their way of thinking , and have a weak ability of adaptation toward a changing environment . People who take risks , for example in an artistical activity , will be awarded because they go against a kind of conformism . This is exactly what we are looking for , in globalised economy . To be successful , we need to be `` different '' , and take risks for that .  To conclude , exploring new fields brings new ideas of business . Risks are the basis of success . Simply , we can say that `` who dares , wins '' , and even if your objective is not to succeed , risks are important in life because they spice up our daily life .	FRE
I agree with the statement .  I think that facts show that most successfull people have tried new things and taken more risks that unsuccessful peolple . For example , most of big computer corporations are owned or managed by people that took many risks in the 1970s and 1980s by betting in the new emerging computer products . Those people took many risks and succeded .  Such reality is in accordance with the economic principle that `` more risk involves more gain '' . Therefore , it is probable that a person who takes risks will have more profits that a person that only does what he knows best . This is under the assumption that the person who takes such risks is a well educated person and not just a gambler .  Also , if a person only does what he already knows how to do best , it will not gain more experience and the knowledge that it will require in order to be successful . For example , if a person only does what he already knows how to do best it will probably never fail . This may seem something good but it is not . It is very important to fail in order to learn from our mistakes . That is why successful persons have often failed numerous times . For example , many of today 's rich people have been declared in bankrupcy many times .  Finally , the results of trying something new is most of the times a new product , which , after having the corresponding trademark rights declared , gives a person the exclusive right to sell it . For example , most successful farmaceuticals have became such due to the invention of new drugs . This could only be achieved because such farmaceuticals took many risk and did things in a different way . It is important to mention that this does not only apply to proffesionals but also to artists . Many artists have been successful because they have performed its art in a different way , taken many risks .	SPA
It is interesting to travel and to know about culture of other countries . When I travel , I usually travel with a tour guide . I become more pleased after I go traveling in a group than traveling freely . I strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because , I can get knowledge and I can spend travel money more effectively .  To begin , I can get knowledge . One of tour guides ' work is to help people to understand the culture of the other countries . Also they need to make sure that they show the culture and some tourists give opportunities to travelers to experience the culture . To illustrate , I went to Hongkong last week and it was very nice . The tourist showed us the culture of Hongkong and not only that , we could also eat food of Hongkong and went to places where Hongkong people usually go in daily life . He also talked about the history of Hongkong that we could understand the culture easily and I became to have interest . Therefore , with tour guide , travelers can know about the countries more deeply .  Moreover , I can use the money that is spent on traveling more effectively . Some people travel to get out of daily work and to get rid of their stress . They think they need to relax during travel but they need money to travel so I think it is not cost effective . For instance , when I went to Cambodia , I did n't go there with a tour guide so I did n't know where to go . So I just spent my time having rest in my hotel room which was wasting my time and money . Even though I could have a rest at home , I chose to spend money and had a rest in other county which was not a good choice to make . Thus , I can save money .  To wrap up , I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . First of all , I can get knowledge and learn deeply about other countries . Also , I can use money that is spent more effectively .	KOR
Today is an era of compititons and for surviving in this competitive age man has found various trends . Publicity is one of the trends man uses to increase the popularity of his products . So i m kind of disagree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''  Now a days we get to see big celebrities like tv and film actors and actresses and even sport persons flashing every now and then on the television endorsing a product or in a news papers . . Pepole may fall for these traps and can end up havin a product which is actually not worth of those huge amounts if not inspected properly . i cant deny the fact that , sometimes in competing with the similar brands these advertisements do show some false statements and just because people trust these brand ambassedors blindly , end up buying that product . so thats why i dont completely disagree with the above statement .  But at the same time in my opinion , viewer should see these advertisements vigilantly and before buying them they shuld examine the product and check out the validity of the statements and claims made in those commercials . It is the duty of the customer to keep in mind that there are some agencies who overrate their own products to improve the sales .  Also , in a country like india there is a governing body called `` ISO '' which checks the authenticity of products and after series of close inspections give them the authority to be sold in the market . So with such authorities lik `` ISO '' overrating a product and advertising is not easily possible .  Advertisemnts help the viewer to discriminate the good and bad qualities of the product by comparing it with other similar brands . It also creates awareness in the minds of customers about the newer and technologically advanced products .  So in conclusion , keeping in mind the advantages of advertising we cant make a generalised statement that products are made to seem better than they really are . It is as a `` customer '' our job to check the authenticity of such products .	HIN
This topic reminds us of the popular question `` what is better : quantity or quality '' . The essay is going to focus of the advantages and disadvantages of having a broadng knowledge of many academic subject versus being specialized in a particular one .  the first part of our essay will enumerate and expalin the advantages of each of them and the second part would discuss the disadvantages . The elementary and seconday education is mostly an all subject teaching rather than a specific . it gives the students the opportunity to have an idea of the different field of study and also give them a variety of choice as per their future career or postseconday education . in may cases the student has enough time to see if he would choose a particular option or career orientation . For example a student who takes physics and biology has various choices of career : he could decide to go into the technical or engineering field or the medical field . In the other hand a student who focuses on a particular subject would definately excell in it in the future because of the time spent studying it . This is particularly true for student in technical schools , who choose their career option from the elementary or seconday level . A student whop attend an aviation maintenance school from his secondary level would have all the necessary tools to succeed in aeronautical engineering for example .  Recalling tghe popular say `` jack of all trades and master of none '' : we see that student who focus on too many subjects end up not mastering any . Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could lead to more confusion also when the time comes to choose a specialization . In the other hand being specialized in only one subject reduces or limits your options for a future career and also exposes you to the economical and geographical changes . After specializing on only one subject and the career is no more attractive , we will be forced to change orientation and start at fresh . An exanple of a student who specializes in nursing from seconday level would only end up enrolling for a nursing degree in  In conclusion we would say that what is better depends greatly on the individual and his ability to use what he has learned .

I completely agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . To support my stand there are three valid points . Firstly , with the advancing technologies newer and faster modes of transportation are coming up like metros , bullet train , intra city express which makes it very convinient for people to travel from one place to another and actually consumes less amount of time as compared to cars which generally takes more time because of the traffic jams and all . People rather commute to far off places in metros and trains and have already started using their cars as mode of transporatation to nearest station if they have such an option .  Secondly , with the arrival of Internet and Video Telecommunication most of the offices find it convinient for its staff to work from their home , eg. Software firms , Business offices and Corporations related with trading of Shares etc . With this trend on , it will take very few years when most of the people will be working from their homes . This will automatically reduce the usage of cars as most of the people use their cars to go to their respective offices .  Finally the most important factor which will determine the reduction in the usage of the car is the scarcity of the fuel . In todays world the consumption of fuel is growing exponentially and it seems there are no means to replenish it , even though various efforts are being made world wide . With limited amount of fuel supply the world wont be able to sustain the demands of the market and finally , to come up with the solution so as to reduce the fuel consumption , people will be motivated not to use cars and other such vehicles . This will automatically determine less usage of cars in the future years .  It might be hard to digest but the way things are turning out to be it seems we will soon stop the usage of one of the most important inventions of human history . And it can be very well assumed that this time duration will be not more than twenty yeras .	HIN
I do not agree with the statement because of the following three reasons . The students will not have chance to confirm that what they know is true , and it might cause the decrease of the students ' interest towards the subject . Also , they will not have ability to adjust their own knowledge to perform in the actual world which is the main reason why students learn . Therefore , it is not more important for studnets to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .  Understanding ideas and concepts are recieving informations from others who have already experienced , and by not being able to actually see how the ideas and concepts work , the students might not be able to have enough interest about the subject as they should be . If the students are not actively experiencing the facts on their own , they can easily doubt that if those ideas and concepts are true in real world . Lacking the ability to see how they actually work can cause the decrease of their interest , which brings negative affects on learning habits .  Students without skills to perform correct actions in the real world often do not have enough experience which comes from learning facts of their own experiences . As they grow up and prepare to play a important role in the society , it is required to have a lot of knowledge as well as enough experience to know how to adjust the knowledge for each specific situations . Students with only ideas and concepts which other people have introduced will lack the ability to gather specific informations of their own and place them into a correct consequences .  It is more important for students to learn facts because it increases the willingness for students to learn as well as the ability to perform better in various situations in the real world .	KOR
In my opinion , there is no general answer to the question whether or not new things and risks will lead to more success than sticking to old shoes . I think it highly depends on the character of a person .  People might be very successful in doing what they have done all their life . Usually , they are very experienced in what they do and with their knowledge and their background they are able to make the right decisions which eventually might lead to a great success .  On the other hand , people who take risks and who are willing to learn new things , new theories and new perspectives , can generally be characterized as more open-minded . They have to arrange with new situations and be more flexible . They have to pay attention to the change of markets and change with their environment . It can also be assumed that people who seek new challenges are more motivated than people who do the same things every day , because they will not get bored by a daily stupidity .  Not only that new challenges lead to new opportunities for success , I also think that having and gaining knowledge in more than one field rather than being a specialist on one certain topic provides a lot more options for success . Being able to follow and take part in discussions on a variety of fields might earn the respect of other people . It is a lot easier to give an objective opinion , if one can verify this opinion through solid experiences in a variety of fields . I think having a wide range of basic knowledge is a lot more impressive than just being able to lecture on one specific topic . People with common sense and a variety of interests might more likely be employed by an employer than probably would be a specialist who has not ever looked beyond his narrow borderlines .  Although I can see situations , where experience in doing familiar things can lead to success , I , as to speak for myself , would prefer learning new things and according to that I would also be willing to take some risks . Despite all these arguments on success , I also think that life is a lot more worth living with the opportunity to face new challenges and learn new things .	GER
I 'm agree with the following statement : `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . I think that young people lives your life more attentment to old people . they go to a party , disco , pub but also cinema , university , teatre , ecc . the young people loves travel and they visit all towns of Europa or Asia . The older people must think at their family and at their children or also their parents . they watch television or walk in the park . they play at `` tre sette '' ( tipycal italian 's play ) Young people havent not too problems and too responsabilities that older people have . young people are the future , they must learn to older people 's error .

Within the following essay I discuss if people trying new things and taking more risks are more succesful than people using well established practices .  For the beginning I give an principal definition of succes , because it is a question of perspective wether someone is succesful or not . Secondly I highlight several arguments on the topic before concluding with my own opinion on it .  Succes is within a society normally a well conscructed and established value . Every value consists normally of an imagination of distinctive goals . Instead succes itself is not adequate to a constructed goal but needs to be constructed by each community of people . Within Western countries who share the same principles of economy and society succes can be defined as earning a lot of money , having a family or simply being happy , whatever this would say . Now my perspective focusses on the economic perspective by earning a lot of money and therefore I definite succes by it .  By stretching the economic face of succes I need to differentiate between new products and well established products . New products are normally accompagnied by a bigger amount of risks and also by a larger scale of innovativity than established products are . The example of franchising worked on earlier this TOEFL fits quite well . It is relatively easy to buy the right of a huge company like Burger King and to produce its products but it also highlights the limitations of own freedom to establish something own . While starting his proper buisness is relatively costly for oneself and is followed by the incertainity of acceptance of the product , it lets some room for creativity and personality . Additionally new innovative products could be sold for higher price .  Nevertheless it could n't be denied that you can earn money with both possibilities . Perhaps it 's not really a question of succes in this case , but of making it a special way .  For my conclusion I emphasize on the hope of everyone to have succes that leads people to start something new and innovative against all odds . This hope might be imaginative but leads researchers to new inventions and at all humanity to progress . So it would be necessary for humanity but not for economic succes at a short range . By using well established practices you can suceed too and by stretching on the example of new products you need an etablished name to sell products better .  Therefore it 's the mixture of both , risk and new ways as well as well established ways that leads to overall success , for individuals , enterprises and humanity .	GER
Traveling is an impotant part of life . rarely there is a person who does not travel or does not like to travel . I think that a person should travel in group , by this a person can have more security . If a person travelling in a group of his friends or family members and they are visiting to some new place they will need a guide . Guide can tells us the historical importance of the places we are visiting to . As the guide knows all the areas and places of interest so he can guide us well . Also if we are visiting to a place where there is different type of language used , guide can act as an interpreter . So I am fully agrre with the idea of travelling in a group led by guide .  First reason that why I am in the favour of tour guide is that the guide can tell us the importance of that place in detail , which otherwise we cant get enough through other sources like books etc. for instance Last year me and my friends visited some historical places in India like Agra , Delhi and Jaipur but we people do n't think like hiring a guide , so v faced much problems over there .  Second reason in favour of hiring a tourist guide is that the guide is well known to the area where we are visting and he knows very well about the other places which we had not heard earliar . So he can make our travel experience more interesting by introducing us to the new places .  Another important reason that I am in the favour of tour guide is that we can easily come over the language problem if we are visiting a place with different language . For example if we are visiting european countries than we might encounter with the language problem over there . And we can come across the difficulty of interacting with people . A tour guide can act as an interpreter between us and the people of the other region we are visiting to .  To summarize , the best way to travel is in group led by tourist guide , so that we can come to know in details about the places we are visiting to , we can enhance our experience by introduction of new places and we can handle the situation of language problem and last but not the least by travelling in a group we can have a sense of security .

Most advertisements make products seem better than they really are . This reminds me of an incident which occurred only a few days ago . I was out shopping with my friends and i was on the look out for a new mobile phone which i had fallen in love with as soon as i saw it on my television screen one fine morning . I had vowed to buy that mobile phone whatever be the consequences . This action can be appraised by the fact that the phone looked really cute in the advertisement and it boasted of many features as well . This phone was the ultimate gadget for any teenager . But i had the ultimate shock when i saw the same mobile phone in the mall . It did not look as cute as it did in the ad , for one thing , and it did not seem to have as many features as it did in the ad . The ad was an illustration of what is defined as cheap publicity . The phone had been wrongly displayed and if it were not for my trust-worthy friends , I would have bought it with all the love i previously had for it and then would have ended up as the loser , disappointed as well .  Most advertisements seem to display products in such a way that the consumer would fall in love with the product just by viewing the advertisement . This can result in serious damage of the customers ' trust in advertisements as well as in the manufacturers of that particular product . The consumers will be heart-broken when they come home and realise that the product , with which they were previously so in love , has really let them down , quality-wise . The advertisers or the manufacturers are hood-winking the consumers into buying their products at high prices , ensuring profits for themselves , but breaking the trust of the consumers nonetheless . The advertisements should be more realistic and they should not display something which the consumer may not find in the product later . The advertisers should only advertise those charactertistics of the products which actually exist and serve a purpose . Not the characteristics that ought to be in a product . If the advertisers are so keen on advertising such characteristics they should suggest to the manufacturers to actually integrate these characteristics into the product and then advertise them so they would not be cheating the customers but actually showing a true , realistic picture .	TEL
I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but the fact is that people is afected when is not aware of this . Also I understand that although there is some regulation obout this topic the means to make it work are not as hard as they should .  Is truth that marketing uses strategies like give misinformation about a product or try to convice us that their product is what we need to solve our problems or just to make us happy . But it could be a real problem like in a medical example , some vitamin suplements are announce to be all we need if we feel tired or weak , but the people who make the publicity do not care or inform consummers about the risk of do not go toa medical check when these synthoms are present . Also there are docummentated cases of people who stop taking their medication or cutted their medical treatments because of using a new product seen on TV .  Another example could be the resistance of a ladder or a new kind tool , because the client could be expecting that this tool or appliance has a certain lasting , when the real thing is that it is going to break even putting in danger his life .  As a final conclution or a personal peace of advice . I think that even though companies have the necesitty to increase their profits they also should have a social conscience . That is to say be more concerned about the responsability of lie or misinformate about the features of a product . And this does not mean that the client should leave everything in the hands of the enterpices , but be more concerned about the posibility of being buying something which is not what he is expecting .

I agree , because people start to think car cost money and polute enviroment and their own health problem now . Cause of bad enviroment , a lot of people have disease , like cancerand especially lung disease . It came from not enough exirsise and air polution . Thesedays , more and more people take care about their health problem and they know that cars makes thier health worse . Also people start to care protecting nature : ozon hall , air polution came from car emission .  Car cost too much money , people keep gasoline in car , and prise of gasoline getting higher . They have to renew car insurense every few year . They have to keep thire own parking . Having a car means costing money evry day . They want to save money , and it is easy to use train or bus or bycicle instead of car . Using a another transportation is much easier than car . Especially train is more quick and cheapest . About 30 years ago , it was a statas having own car . However , now being natural is one of trend . I t si thougt Cool ! Also having a car that make people non-active person . Ameria is the best example , most of americans go to office or school by car . It makes American pepole fatter and fatter . I know the best way to solve all of these problems . We have to walk our own legs . Do not rely on car so much .	JPN
Although young peolpe are more outgoing than older people , I do not agree with this statement . Older people are mostly retired and have much more time and money to go on trips and travel to other countrys . Younger people on the other hand have to learn often and do not have that much money to travel a lot . But they are more interested in discovering new countrys and make new experiences . In comparison , older people already have a lot of experience and they often , just want to visite places where they have been before rather than go on exiting trips .  However , older peole often have problems with their health and therefore they are not as flexible as young people are . Young people can do whatever they want , whithout thinking about their health . Older people therefore are more interested in their own family , which is often the most important topic in their lifes . And to my opinion it is far better to see your own grantchildren growing up than going into discos and stay up all night , what a lot of younger people do .  To sum up the main points , I do not think that younger people enjoy their life more than older people do , because there are so many things that older people can do which younger can not do . To my opinion older people enjoy their lifes different than younger people do , but there is no better way .	GER
It has been long discussed if it is more important for students to understand ideas amd concepts than it is for them to learn facts . I disagree with the statements that it is more important for students to understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .  Facts are the things that we seen that is virtue and used as the basic of the ideas and concept . You can hardly tells weather the concepts and the ideals are true or false , because everyone had his or her owe observations . We know know that neithergh the Earth nor the Sun is the certal of the universe , but most of the people believed that the concept that the Earth is the certail of the univese .  Also concept s and ideals always determine our own thoughts and lead it to the wronf or even opposite way , and take us far away from the truth . It is widely known that the reaserches of the brain cells had not made any progress for years since the sicentists use their concepts and ideals out of date to anylses the brain cells . This concepts that every kinds of brain cells use the electrocity to transfer their signals made them totally ignore the importance of the other cells .  The last but not the least the facts not only provide us the matereals to observe but also functioned as the inspiration of the sicentists . By learning the facts we can thinking in our own way and then leart to select the best way of thinkin . As we know that men must suffer to be wise . If you suffered from your own thinking and figue out what the facts reflected , you will finally be able to handle the problems that you will face . By this way people became much more matrue , and knows the essential of life which do not had the concepts of how to live in a good life .	CHI
Today advertisement can convice consumers that every kind of product is the best one and that you ca n't live without it . There are a lot of tecniques that make a product irresistible for consumers . But is always true that all advertised products are so good like it seem to be ? I think is not : they seem much better than they really are . Last week I bought an apple pie that I saw on a television spot . In the images reported on tv it seems realy testy and healthy , but when I eat it , it was not so good and I got sick . I could n't sleep all night long .  In my opinion it would be better for food or dress companies to spend their budjet improving the quality of their products or decreasing the prices instead of invest it on advertisement .  The problem is that business rules are different from what is better for the people . But something has to be done . I think that certification of qulity are a very good investment for the companies to show the real value of their product end in the same time a good way for consumers to verify the quality of what they are buying and choice better between different brands .

Nowadays , purchasing behavior is more and more influenced by the advertisements . There are advertisements on TV , newspaper , radio , internet and street . These advertisements may guide us on how to buy a product . It is hard to imagine a life without advertisements . Does these advertisements always play a positive role on us ? I am afraid that I can not agree . There are too many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  The advertisements will make the product very attractive , so people will buy more and more products under this motive ; however after purchasing , people find that the product is not as effective as it is advertised . The reason is that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . For example , there are many medicine advertisements state that the medicine will soothe pains and cure disease very quickly . People suffering from pains and disease will buy the medicine becuase they believe what is promoted in the advertisements . These medicine advertisements have exaggerated the fact . Even though you follow the rules , the medicine will not solve your problems as easily as it is stated .  Further more , in order to attract more and more audiences to buy the product , the advertisements may even provide false information to make products seem better . I have heard too many stories from my friends that they purchase high price cosmetics after seeing advertisements . When they try on the cosmetic , it does not improve the situation at all , some may even harm their skin . I have to say that these advertisements are not responsible at all . They only show us the best examples , but do not explain the product in a moderate and correct way .  I do not deny the fact that there may be some advertisements truly show and promote the product , but I think the number is pretty less . Most of the advertisements appear not as good as they really are .	CHI
HAVING A BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY ACADEMIC SUBJECTS , OR SPECIALIZING IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT ?  Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make the students know a little of every subject but it wo n't get focused on a specific subject . Specializing in one specific subject can make the students know everything in one subject but wo n't make them know almost anything about other subjects .  People choose jobs and they only have to know all the information about that specific subject that they work on . They are n't responsible to know information about any other subject . These way the distrubition of jobs are formed .  Although this way job distrubitions are formed , knowing everything about one subject can make people boring . Knowing a little about every subject makes people open minded and more interesting . They can look at the world at different angles and since humans are social livings , a little color into everyone 's life is needed .  If people only knew about one topic and had no idea about any other topic , everybody would be boring . People would only make friends with people of the same job type because they would have no common subject with people of other job types .  If the people knew a little of everything and did not focus on one topic , then everybody would have to do all of its work itself and no job distribution would be made . Also subjects like science , history , geography , surgery , etc . . would not go alot of distance because nobody would be working on mainly one topic . This way new inventions and explorements would not be made .  In the conclusion , I think only focusing on one subject and not knowing anything about other topics , also knowing a little of every topic and not focusing on one are both bad but if I had to choose one , I would say that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because this way the standards of life do not decrease , only people get more boring and have friends only of their own area of knowledge , but by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects make the life standards decrease .

In our era , the value of everything is evaluated by its image created in the minds of humankind . The most popular technique of creating the desired image is using marketing methodologies . One of the most valid and prevailing marketing tactics is advertising . Some factions think that advertisements have the power to make products seem better than they are really , while the other factions assert that it is impossible to make a product seem better by making customers deceive thanks to lots of legal legislations and institutional controls . However , to me , both sides can be correct in different conditions .  First , not all the countries have laws and legislations for broadcasting fair advertisement that reflects the product just like as it is . In that case , producer can make his product seem more qualified in the advertisements . To illustrate , the cream used for decoration located on top of cakes . In the advertisements , the manufacturer can use shaving cream instead of cake cream in order to benefit from shaving cream 's durability and viscosity , are there not any regulations about the ethics that should be conducted in the advertisements . Because they have the same color , nobody can distinguish the shaving cream that is displayed in the advertisement as the cake cream from normal cake cream , and all advertisement viewers would probably think that it is a marvellous brand to buy comparing to others as no normal cake cream can seem of such good shape and durability . As a result , if there is no legal stimulus for advertisements , with the help of spurious counterparts , the product may be demonstrated as more qualified .  However , if there is enough legislation for advertising procedures in a country , it is impossible to guile the customers by giving false information about product or using a counterfeit product , as the manufacturer is aware of the fact that he will be punished by the laws , if he even tempts to do it . For instance , in the USA , if a producer wants an actor to give a testimony for his product , it is a must that the actor should use the product for 6 months before the advertisement .  In summary , in the advertisements it is quite possible to make the product seem more qualified than it is if there are no laws about that . So more laws should be accepted in that issue .	TUR
So different are the personal experiences and emotional among people with diverse culture that thousand individuals might hold thousand opinions . As far as I am concerned , I generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  First of all , one of the central reasons that can be presented my position is the things have been done by the successful people take long time experiences to make it better . Examples can easily be found to support my view . The most famous inventor , Edison , he invented light in very early period . However , he did n't spend time on how to improve his invention well . After long time of life experiences , others improved the light better , such as the clour and the used time . Under the circumstance , successfull people try new things and take risks is much better  In addition , another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing 's come out can increase the possibility of others related new products ' inventions . This example can tell it right . The light came out soon after the discover of electrcity , because these two inventions have something in common or relation . As a result , the siccessful people always succeeded in making lists of new things after they made one . This can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going , but staying behind .  However , I dont want to overstate the advantage of my agreement , since it also still suffers from some comparative merits in some sperical cases . Firstly , when people try to invent new things , it takes long time to reach the achivement . Seconly ,  To sum up , according to above mentioned reasons and examples , successful people should try new things and take risks becomes more convincing to me , although it has some own negative aspects which we can not deny .

I agree with the statement as it is true that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The producers are using the latest trends of marketting , advertising and promoting their products . Some of the common methods used are - Promotions , Product Launch Offers , Door to Door selling , Discounts etc.allt hese methods motivate the consumer to purchase these goods without even knowing what the good is actually made out of or what is the goods actual function .  Advertisements make the product look really appealing and user friendly . For example an add for a car would usually include the car speeding away really fast and about the interior technology and luxury of the car . But what the add does not tell the consumers is that speeding away causes accidents , Technology advances everyday , etc .  A good add should be planned in a manner to show the use of the car that is how can it help not only you but other people aswell or even the environment . If the add for the car displayed the comfort , the space available in the car , etc it would be more usefull for the people .  Advertising is taking over the marketting sector tremendously . Adds in forms of banners , flyers , stalls etc are providing all the information to the people and these methods make sure that the consumer looks at the product ina apositive manner .  Usually the quality , functioning and looks of a product are quite different from what they appear on an add and this makes the consumer suffer . Some of the adds provide us with the information we dont need and some of them diplay material which offend people culturaly , religiously or make them feel at a low status in the society . Example - An add for an underwear would display the man wearing it and running behind a horse which is not true .  I conclude this essay in regard to ensure people that they are aware of what they consume and how is it gonna affect them or others or wether it would still be of any help for the consumer in the future .

I do n't agree to the statement . I love to travel alone . There are some differences between travel alone and travel in a group led by a tour guide . First , I think that a travel must be free . If I have an oppotunity to my trip , the place I want to go is n't same with my friend or whole group members . Joining the group and ledding by a tour guide makes it impossible to go to the place where I want to go . A tour is a thing which goes only to the place where someone selected before start .  Second , I think that a travel should be flexible . You may want to go many places like the place you see from a train window , or you find a place where does n't printed on your guide book . To change the route from you thougut before your trip is one of preasures of travel .  In the end , I think a travel give a chance to meet new friends . I do n't t need group member because i can find a new friends who has same opottunity with me . If I had a question , there are someone who has a lot of knowledge about there .  So , I think the best way to travel is go alone .	JPN
In my opinion the stated argument is right and the amount of cars will decrease during the next twenty years . There are many alternatives to using a car , there will not be enough space on the routs for all those cars . In addition I am sure that there will be certain laws in the future to keep the amount of cars at a certain level .  Today one can use the train , a ship , a plan or even the public transport systen to reach diffgerent places . Those alternatives will become more attractive because of technological progress which will finally make the use cheaper . Many people in Germany for example prefer to take the train because it is more convinient and it is sure to arrive on time .  Furthermore the oil price increased during the last years and a change can not be seen . The industry reacted to this problem by building engines which need less petrol but because of the eclectronical equipment the sum of needed petrol could not be reduced .  Another argument is that cities will become more overcroweded and there will not be enough space for new cars . For example in Japan is not enough space for new buildings and the streets have reached a critical size which can not be enlarged . One solution is that people just share cars to to go to work .  And finaly there will be certain laws to keep the amount of cars on a certain level . The world has many problems with pollution and governmants just started for example to introduce special laws in the faster growing economies . By doing this the states want that industry and common people pay more attention to their use of energy . If this group changes its behaviour one consequence could be that less new cars will be bought .  In conlusion this are my three main arguments why there will be fewer cars in 20 years .	GER
In this fashion era , people usually want to try diverse new things such as food , technology , and clothing . Successful people normally will try new things and take risks rather than just only doing what they already know . This is why some investors are so successful in nowadays . People would love to try products and style which they have never seen rather than just repeating the same idea over and over again .  Investors usually try to make high profit of business . In order to let the customers feel different , the company needs to keep changing . If a company sells housing technologys such as freezers and microwaves , and suddenly it starts to produce cell phones and computers . Customers will have such a different impression rapidly about the company since they think the company only sells housing technology . Buyers now will not need to run to couple different places to buy freezers and computersIf if they want to buy it at the same time .  Businessman should also love to take risks . Risk does not necessary mean an hurmful thing . People who are willing to take the risk will most likely to achieve success . Creative work can open customer 's mind . We will never know what customes want . If buyers are suprised by the company , he definetly will have a excellent impression about the company . For example , clothing , the designers sometimes need to take the risk if they have a very different idea what to design . The designer are not sure whether the audiences and buyers will like it . Even if they do not like it , at least he tries .  Two common methods should be used in order to achieve success : trying new things and taking risks . We can find out from almost every single great investors around the world . Without these methods , they will probably not be as successful as they are today .	CHI
One of the major problems of ` homo-urbanis ' , that is , the human being living in urban areas , is transportation . With each day , our roads are becoming crammed with an increased number of cars and our air being infused with higher density of vehicular pollution . Obviously there is a limit to how much our infrastructure can support . What happens when there are so many cars on the road that there is no more place to move ?  That is a rather scary vision . However , it may well be that the number of cars on the roads twenty years from now will actually be less than what it is today .  Is n't that a rather exaggerated claim ? After all , even if the world population stabilizes as the estimates have indicated , it will still be much larger than what it is today . And with increased economic prosperity , more and more people can be expected to own more and more cars .  True . However , if the current trends are any clue , the number of cars should nevertheless reduce .  First of all , many countries , especially developing nations with large populations , are rapidly developing their public transport systems to tackle the problem of urban transportation . Public transport systems are not only more cost effective , they also ensure a better quality of living by eliminating traffic jams and exposure to vehicular pollution . Therefore , it will not really be surprising if more and more people take to public transport as the primary means of moving about .  Second , fuel prices are expected to rise heavily in next twenty years as world oil reserves get delpleted . In such a scenario , it will be much more economical for people to use public transportation systems .  Such trends are already showing in countries like India . The Delhi Metro is a success story that well illustrates the point . With high quality service available at low prices , even the rich and affluent of Delhi prefer to keep their cars at home and use the Metro when they need to travel to the crowded areas of the city . Rapid Bus Transit Systems introduced in cities like Indore and Bhopal are becoming increasingly popular amongst citizens .  Thus , the day may not be far when you might be the only person driving on the road ! In fact , if one wants a better quality of living for one and all , one should actually hope that it happens .

Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience , but in my opinion , when we first experience something we enjoy it more . There is a saying that a thing is attractive untill you get it , in other words , when you wish for something and do not get it easily , you are more keen to get it . After getting that thing , you loose your interest in it . This is the human nature . So the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older , because they experience things for very first time . I also agree with this opinion that young persons enjoy life more than older people .  To support my opinion , firstly , I would like to disscuss the tendency or the nature of youngers . First of all , they are very curious about new things . They want to explore everything regardless of danger associated with it .  For example , when I was a kid , I was always curious about parachute , and one day what happened , I just jumped from my roof top with an umbrella . At that time I did not know , what is fear . So meaning is that , you can not expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person . Even , if an old person does not know the harm associated with the task , he/she might not take risk .  Secondly , youth do not care for moral values , whereas old people do follow them strictly . From their experience of life , senior people know the value of ethics and would like to follow always . On the other hand , teenagers are unlikely to follow the moral values , or they follow reluctantly .  Thirdly , In my opinion , you can enjoy the life if you do n't have restriction on you activities . Old people have resposibilities towards society , as well as towards their own family . While youngers are free to do whatever they want . For an instance , I like to dance publically , and I do whenever I get chance to do it . But I know some older people can not do it because first they think about others opinion such as , what would the society think , or what would be the impact on children .  Last but not the least , young people are always open to new ideas or cultures , while older people have narrow mind . It is easy for a younger to adapt a new culture in order to learn it . On the other hand , senior persons are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it .  Conclusion is that , although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own life time experiences , I strongly hold the view that youngers enjoy the life more than them . The main reasons are , will to explore new things , no responsibility , less regard for values or ethics , and more energy to enjoy life .	HIN
During almost 18 years , I studied many courses and I know the best way to learn . So what I am sure about : the idea is the most important thing to understand than the facts . I will explain this in two general parts : the first part will be about the idea that a fact is one example of the idea ; and the second one will deal with the fact that we can easier an idea than a fact .  So first , it is obvious that the idea is most important thing to understand because the facts are just some cases of the main idea . Usually , during the classes , the teachers try to explain us an example which permits to understand the idea . For example , to better understand the idea that people is calm when they listen music , it 's to give the example that in many medical rooms , we can hear some classical or jazz music . But it is not the point expected to learn . Thus , this is something we can use to better understand something else .  When we try to make our own opinion , we use the ideas memorised to think . In this important case , we can see why it is so more important to learn the ideas than the facts . If we continue with our previous example , what do we think about the importance of Music in the world ? To answer , we could select the idea that Music calms people and we could use it to conclude that without Music , there will might be more Wars in the World , and so , most of the population of the Earth will be sad . It is in this way I see the importance of the ideas .  As I proved in this response , to better learn , we have to more concentrate on the ideas than on the facts . But the facts are needed to understand the ideas . So , in the perfect case , we would care about ideas as well as facts .	FRE
I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reaons .  First , I believe that the governments of many countries in the world are recently beginning to restrict the use of cars because of their several serious problems . For example , cars emit carbon monoxide when they burn gasoline , which is poisonous to people , animals and plants . In addition , cars also emit caron dioxide which is responsible for the greenhouse effect .  Second , the governments also restrict the use of vehicles due to fear to depletion of natural resources , especially petroleum . That valuable natural resource is necessary for vehicles to move -- i.e. , to burn gasoline . In addition , it is necessary to manufacture vehicles . For example , the process of manufacturing cars needs high temperature which is given by petroleum . Moreover , cars use plastics as parts thereof , and needless to say , plastics are produced from petroleum .  In addition , according to medias and recent official reports by United Nations , the governments of many countries in the world are not only beginning to restrict the use of cars , but also trying to find alternative transportaions which do not have problems which cars have . For example , in my nation , Japan , the govenment has been investing in the research for commercializing of the `` linear motor car '' . It moves by energy of magnetts , so that does not emit any poisonous gas . Experts estimate that the linear motor car will be used more popurarly in 15 years .  Therefore , I agree the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in used than there are today for there reasons .	JPN
I mainly agree with that statement . But it is important in which relationship this statement has to bee seen . I think for example that it is correct if it is related to languages . It is obvious better to speak a little bit of english , french , german and italian than only one of them perfectly . Concerning the profession I have to disagree with the statement . In today 's economic situation it is better to be specified . The unemployment is so high that it is possible to be well educated but yet unemployed if you are not specialized enough . On the other hand a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects can be better , if you have to manage for example your own firm and can not rely on other specialists .  It is important to notice that a broad knowledge is the base for further knowledge in these areas . So if you do not have any variety of knowledge it is much harder to gain experiences in those unrevealed areas . Especially in the actual situation it is important to be flexible and to be willing to keep on learning during your whole lifetime . If you were a specialist in one certain subject you probably would not be willing to listen to more actual information because of your status as specialist .  It clearly depends on one 's character but my oppinion is , that specialization is minor in contrast to a broad knowledge of many subjets . As I stated above the base is the most important thing . Afterwards there is still time to specialize certain subjects in which you are interested in . If you do not know all the possibilities you can not be sure having chosen the right way .  I would prefer a broad knowledge because then I stil have all possibilities . If I specialized and chose wrong , I would be dissapointed . You do not know how the future will be that is why specialization is such a dangerous thing . It is better to be eventually less qualified in a lot of subjects than to be specialized in one which no one needs .  So in general I would agree with the statement . Specialization comes after the broad base of many academic subjects .	GER
although facts provide a clear and better opinion for a particular subject but personally i think that to understand the basic concepts and the main idea behind the subject is much better as compared to simply knowing the facts . so i agree with the statement that it is more important to understnd ideas and concepts then merely learning the facts .  as we see that students in their schools or colleges perform much better when they understand the concepts well and have a clear idea of the subject that is being taught . they never have to cram the things when the basic concept is clear in their mind . also they never forget that thing for the entire life . knowing the facts may fetch them good marks but they forget the subject within a short span of time .  secondly , the workers in an office show much better performance when they understand the basic concept and the main idea behind the project they are working on . simply knowing the facts would not generate an effective result . so in order to get a better promotion they have to learn the concepts well so that they perform well . like in todays world one must have the idea and concept of a computer to perform well in office or in his or her job .  thirdly , it is very important for a player of any game to know the basic concept of the game rather then the facts . when i learened to play football my coach told me the main concept behind the game and hence i play the game well . simply knowing the facts about football can not make me a good player .  thus we saw that how knowing the concepts and the basic ideas behind a subject is much better than by simply knowing the facts .	HIN
In my opinion there is no single correct answer to this question . Of course both ways can lead to success . My main reasoning is that it depends on the path one wants to follow whether an academic specialization makes sense or not . My aim is to explain this argument in the following sentences by looking at the broad academic field of business .  In Switzerland , a masters student can choose whether he wants to specialize in one specific subject - as finance - or to keep his focus on a broad approach which includes subjects such as marketing , human resources , finance , strategic management , risk management , leadership .  To illustrate my hypothesis mentioned above I will now have a look at two different jobs within a company .  A general manager and his management team need not to be specialized in one specific subject as they have to address problems of many different fields - such as leadership issues , marketing decisions and financial topics . An important aspect in the job of a manager is the need to quickly decide on many different issues . Thus a broad education is actually an advantage .  An employee in the financial sector such as in a bank does not need to have such a broad knowledge . Rather it is essential that he possesses in-depth knowledge of the transactions within the sector and on the sector itself . The job requirement is much more focused . Rather than just knowing little about everything it is advisable to have a solid knowledge of this special topic - and finance for example is actually still a rather broad subject .  But of course it is needless to say that knowledge is allways an added asset . However one has to decide first which path will be chosen in order to be able to make a sound decision whether an academic specialization makes sense .	GER
One for all and all for one , each one have the right to be in a society , and involved in a community , and be a part of it , and every part of the community has to build it up .  Every person in the community has to work for acheiving the community 's golas , he should give efforts to reach these goals , by improving there societies they improve themselves , everyone should share in helping the community , every thinkinful person have to encourage and motivate other people to help in anyway , as an example : everyone who can pay from his extra money . is paying for a charity for helping poor young people to learn in shools , to prevent food for them , homes , maybe clothes , young people might not be able to pay money , they might be able to do some jobs , such as teaching the young kids , babysitting for the babies , making food , gathering things , maybe if they arrange certain days for making certain activities , like the cleaning day or week , which everyone in a certain age has to come and share in the cleaning .  Young people have to improve their skills and themselves , by reading , learning , escpically the third world countrie 's people , they have to raise up their countries and communities , young people might do meetings for discussing what to do for improving their societies and their communities , I think there are many ideas in order to make young people do somethings to their communities they have to give some efforts to them , I admit that if young people do something , they will do it in perfect ways that lead their communities for being built up and improved , and at last the one should never forget what his community did for him and try to pay it back and work for it	ARA
I agree in parts with the statement that the `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . The statement stated by the author seems to be correct at some situation and proves to be wrong at other situations making this statement as debatable . I will give some example to prove my point in this essay .  The statement of author mentions `` enjoyment of life '' . This term is very relative in respect of peoples . Every person try to live his life colourfully in his own way . If enjoy means partying then it may be possible that young people are doing more frequently than older people but when it comes to celebrate then older people are not step back from the younger generations .  I do agree sometimes because younger generations are having better and suitable conditions for the time to enjoy . Young peoples are enthusiastic , active and having energy to enjoy the sports events by playing and cheering , they are very eager to explore the new places . Young People having interests for movie go for it whenever they get time , They go for picnic to have a change and the thing that generally many young people enjoy that is to dance continuously for hours . They enjoy various foods of different taste at many of the times . This can be termed as enjoyment .  If we accept the author statement then it would be like that older peoples are not enjoying but carrying thier life ahead only . The things which are done by younger generation are being done by older generation earlier and thus they lost the charm in those things and they are not having enough strength to do the same thing continously . But they are enjoying in different manner , sitting on a chair taking sunbath , Reading newspaper and giving advices to younger generations . They are not able to taste various foods because of their physical conditions but even taking that food by hiding from other people . They are the leader of the house , they are having certain responsibilities to be taken care of . This can also be termed as enjoyment but of some different kind .  In Sum we can say this point is quite debatable and needs to do sampling of people and other techniques to reach some conclusion .	HIN
In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I agree with this statement . The reason is simple . Now there is too muche pollution . If we want to save the world we must reduce the pollution and one way is the reduction of the cars in use . We must implement ecological alternatives .  Earth is collapsing , too much pollution . One of the most important factor of high pollution is the presence of many cars . cars are becomed a mass way of transport and in many cities it is used in the wrong way , for example one car is used only by one man instead of three or four . We must change that . It is not difficult .  We must improve our behevior toward ecologic problems . One way for example is using public transport . by using pubblic transports there will bw fewer cars in use . Fewer cars in use mean less pollution . I 'm sure that is one of the reason that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .  I see a world in the future with less cars , less pollution , more attention to the environment . I can see happy kids in big city parks , running and screaming , people with large smiles on its face . May be it is only a dream , may be it is only a hope , it must be our future .  Changing ways of life is difficult and it has high costs but surely this is the straight way to follow .	ITA
No wonder young people enjoy life more than older people . In my opinion , in the early ages people can do lots of things easily without worring anything . They just decide and enjoy what they do . I agree that young people have more chance to enjoy life for the following reasons : having less dependencies than older people , and the desire of learning new information and having experience .  First , young people have less dependencies such as looking after someone , the need of earning money or health issues - obstacles for travelling countries - than older people have . Young people are able to travel different countries easily without thinking anybody stays back like children . For example , my parents have three children including me . If they want to travel to Spain during the rest of their time , they can not leave their children because children need to be looked after . In this case , young people who do not have any children can easily go for travelling .  Moreover , young people usually want to learn and gain a lot of different kinds of experience during their early ages . I can remember , when my brother was nineteen he used to go to music festivals , theathers , and travel a lot . Basically , he enjoyed a lot because he had time , sufficent amount of money and energy . Also , he could easily adapt difficult conditions whatever he faced with . I can not imagine that older people join a party and a boat trip at the same day .  In conclusion , older people and young people can not be compared ehether young people enjoy the life more than older people or not . So basically , young people should be aware of their opportunities in order to enjoy the time .	TUR
Every one in this world likes to travel . Travel teach you a new things and make you sometimes feel better . There are a lot of people like to travel as a group . Maybe because there are going to a new place and no one no about it , then they decide to have tour guide . I am agree with a tour guide for three reasons .  First of all , you can find very good tourism places . For example , if you go to any city and you do n't about it any thing if you have a tour guide , he will show every thing . In addition , he has more experience than you because his city . There is no tourism can know your city more than you .  Second , you will never get lost that mean you will not lose more time . As an example , I and my friends went to Los Angles , and we do n't know anything about this ; however , we lost 3 hours looking for our hotel . On the other hand , if we had a tour guide , we would n't lost all that time .  Third , get yourself away from dengerous places . every huge city has dengerous places , if you do n't where are they , you will but yourself in denger . For instance , there are many crimes these days , you have to be becarful if you to city is not your city , but if you with a group and you have a tour guide maybe is better for you .  In sammury , I suggest thet every one want to travel to have	ARA
I believe the statement which tells `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects '' because more knowledge youhave , more job you can get , and sometimes broad knowledge makes you become more trustful person after the graduation from the university because people are tend to trust a person who have more knowledge than they do .  If person have broad knowledge , it will make people around you to be more unitize , and it will make this person as a great leader . For example , I trust the person who have more knoeledge than I do . My football coach have a lot of experience than I do because he plays football in NFL for 4 years . Because of he have more professional skill and knowledge , everybody trust him . Then I realize that the more knowledge you have more trust you got from other people . The trust unit the team , and it makes a team stronger . it is not only for sports , this statement fits in the company too . If you have trustful boss , your company will unit more than having a untrustful boss . However , broad knowledge makes change of your surrounding , and it also helps to be a great leader .  Because of people are tend to believe a person who have more knowledge than they do , the broad knowledge will be needed by a person who like to have a lot of frineds around you . The people who have a lot of kind friends always have broad knowledge . They have friends who is good at history , math , computer , and sports because the people who have a lot of friends have a lot of connection between these kind of people . Without any connection , nobody want to be a friend because they will not have a topic that they are going to talk about . However the broad knowledge are needed to make a lot of friends who will support your life after the gruduation .  It is better to learning a lot of academic subject before you graduate from university because it will help you after the schoollife .	JPN
In todays modern life every individual wants to understand and capability to estimate the ideas and concepts of the other person . By which he improvises his ideas and overcome withbetterideas than the other person . So I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . I would like to support this statement for following reasons .  First , By understanding the ideas and concepts we get the clear image on the aspect . For example if we are studying a particular subject . In that subject it is impportant for us to identify the main idea of the topic and the concept involved in that particular topic . By simply learning the subject without understanding the concepts then it will be mystery for us that subject even if we spend lot of time on that .  second , By understanding the ideas and concepts we are able to know how to live in the society . That means we are capable how to deal with the problems and our colliques . For example if we want to ride a car , we must first understand the ideas and concepts that means how to start the car , how to accelerate , how to move an gears . By understanding all these and thes if we practice then it will be easy for to ride the car , not only just learning helps us .  Third , when we find out with new softwares or subjects , it will be better for u sif we have understand the main idea and waht are the improvements ovewr previous one then these softwartes will be useful fo us .  Consequently the conclusion is that we must learn facts and we must also understand the ideas and concepts what we learn then only it will be useful for us . Simply learning will not help us	TEL
I think that in twenty years there will be flying cars ! Today the car is become a status symbol , there is n't a family without a car , but the problem is that there are a lot of people who prefere to have a beautiful car than a sweet home . The famous sentence `` home sweet home '' is in danger because is not more at the first place of the desires . A car was the symbol of a generation , our parents remember their first car like a realized dream , today the guys want a car because the best friend has one and not because they understand the real meaning that it can have . I think that in twenty years this object of desire will be more wanted , more desired and more dangerous . .. There are just now a lot of car that ride too fast , in the twenty 's it will be certainly worst . Today young people die because they can drive cars that run very fast , tomorrow they will can fly . I hope it will be different . At my grandfather 's time the car was a luxury good because he cold n't have one . A car is a lot of money and when there was the war money are ghosts . In the sixties some people like Corradino d'Ascanio created a way to help these person to discover the world : Vespa . This has been a real status symbol thanks to the great meanings it had . `` With Vespa you can fly '' and with this beginning , motors became the most important thing for people . In the sixties it was possible to fly away , tomorrow it will be possible too ? It 's important to be free , with a car I can be free because I can go wherever I want . For this reason there is the fewer cars . A fewer that will never pass .	ITA
I agree with the statement and I do think understanding ideas and concepts is really important for students . And I have three reasons .  First , it 's quite necessary to understand the ideas and knowledge when students first learn them . In this way they learn more effectively than simply memorize the facts we come across . Also , a good understanding of the knowledge would help students recall what they learned before . If the study is all about reciting and memorizing , there would be not a better student than a computer .  Second , as my teachers always told me that students should learn `` how to learn '' , rather than gain the knowledge only . And believe that 's the real purpose of education , to teach the student how to think and solve new problems they will meet in the future . My high school could be a bad example . When I studied there , although my teathers told me it was important to know how to learn , cared too much about memorizing . It was indicated in the exams . In order to get a good mark of the examinations , all we should do is to copy the facts into our minds . What 's worse , the process of study was so fast that we could n't have time to have a good thinking about the ideas . As a result , I only can remember a few of the things I learned from the high school textbooks now .  In addition , to understand and take a deeper thinking of what we learn is the way how we 've developed our cultures from the very beginning ! It 's the way we gain the knowledge from the people before and create new ideas of our own . Image if all the students do n't learn how to understand and how to thinking deeply , how would be the future society like ? !  In a word , the way I see it , it 's not only important but also fairly necessary for students to understand ideas and think more about what they learn .	CHI
I think the statement is to absolute . I remeber when i was young , there where not that much possibilities to help the community and they where also not attractive to young people . There is also a big difference where you live . In large city there are not that many communities you can evolve like they are in smaller villages or smaller towns .  Another point is the fact that nowadays young people have a lot more to do and not that much time like it was years ago . They have to go to school or learn a lot and most young people have to work besides their school to earn money to life . If they already have a job besides school they propably will not take a community job without getting paid . They do not have the time and the money to help the community .  Working in the community has also advantages wich most young people do not know about . A community job integrates you in your environment if you are new . It can also help you to find friends , or the community helps you if you got a problem . It also can give you social hold if you do not know what to do or have no other things in you live . It is a good way for older people who do not have to work anymore to get a job for their live . And to get integrated in their social envionment .  But in my oppinon it is true , young people do not give enough time to their communities . Even if it is not the same that it was years ago . The most important point is the social contact they get in their community .	GER
When it comes to learning facts , some people argue that it is easy way to understand some methods . Personally , I think that students are needed to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . This is because understanding ideas and concepts widen peoples intellectuals and people can use these ideas more practical ways .  First of all , students can broaden their intellectuals horizons by understanding ideas and conceps . In the case of learning facts , it is obvious that help people recognize some physical thing . However , these facial and physical thing only allows students to learn those facts . This would limites people 's imagination that they can not undertand above thing such as using other fields . For example , one of the most famous scientist in Korean , Ho Jin Moon , once said that when he was young , he had toughted by teachers who just conveyed fact information to students . His parents thought that these methods would restricts thier son 's understanding so that they moved America . At there , he could take more idea based education and when he grows up , he returned to mother nations and have eagared to disffutes ideas and concept based educations . He argues that by taking this education students can undertants more in-depts knowleges .  On top of that , people can use thier knowledges in practical ways . In today 's society , people are bound and driven hectic schedules , this hectic atmosphere make people only focus on the facts so that they can not use thier knowleges only in few fields . However , the basic ideas and concepts in education are liked each other . Especially in science , if they undertand this basic concepts , learning scientific concept is more easy . To demonstrate , according to a study released by the Korean National Research Center , more than two thirds of surveyed scientists responsed that understanding ideas and concepts more important because by doing this , students can like thier knowledge not only thier major fields , but also the other silimal scientific fields . They said that electronic science can be useful in manufactualing engineering so that studnets who majoring engineering are needed to understand electronic sciendce basically .  In conclusion , I strongly believe that students should focus on understanding ideas and concepts dut to they can widen their intelectuals horizons and	KOR
It is true that there are many reasons such as increasing number of using public transportaion that support decline of car supply . However I have other opinins why there will be more cars on the road instead of decline .  First people try to have their own car personally , not one in a family . In family , for exaple , father need his car to go his workplace . Mother need her car to go her workplace . Even though she does not have job , she also need car to use pick up her kids or go shopping . There is also demands from children when they grow up and become age of owinig a car ; when they go to colloege . As a results all members need . Therefore each person need car . As a result , increasing cars in society .  Second , trend of living a little distance from workplace increase demand of car . Nowdays korea people , internationally also , prefer to live 30min . to 1hr . distance from their work . This mean they need automobils to go their work . For insatace , my professor who lives one hour distance from college , has her own car . She come school every morning using her car , not subway .  It is true that there is increasing number of people who use public transportation to save money , oil or etc . However , this does not mean they do not have car . They have car their own but just use public transportation in order to save money . When they are run out of time , when they feel tired to waitng bus , or when they want to go somewhere where public transportation do not go , they will take out their personal car and drive .  therfore , the need of owning car each of one person , the trend of move distance from workplace make increasing of car demand . futhermore , even though some people use pblic transportation , they surely posses car . as a results , there will be more cars in the road than now .

How does someone enjoy life at all ? What do you need in order to enjoy life ? Young people usually have less problems . Especially when they are very young they dont have much to worry about . Everything they should worry about is already been taking care of by their parents . And they do n't even have a sense or a feeling yet for issues that are uncertain and one could worry about . Since worrying is a stopper and is something that slows down enjoyment very young people enjoy life more that older in that respect .  But to really enjoy something you have to be not only of no worries but you also have to aprecciate the action that you are performing , the situation that you are into and so on . Young people having less experience in life and due to good partens less experience in unhappy and unsatisfied time of life can not aprecciate things to the extend adults do . Someone once said : You dont know that sugar is worth unless you have tasted salt . Older people have tasted salt . So they know how to aprecciate when tasting sugar .  Enjoying life can also mean to accomplish the dreams that you have . This can be a certain style of life with having a wife and children , a good job or a something materialistic . First of all young people do not have access to certain areas like a good job , are not able to drive a car yet and when they are able to they mostly can not afford their dream car due to the lack of financial means . Again if they are really young they might not even think of these things and so they wo n't miss them . But as soon as they get older they have all kinds of dreams and much of them are not fullfiled in the near past since young people dont have the money or age or knowledge for it . Older people however had a fairly good time of their lives to work towards their dreams . They are more likely to be in a stage that they at least could accomlish the most urgent dream , the one that was really important to them for all of their lives .  This enjoyment however can again be stopped . This is the case when older people look past and remember the things the didnt achive rather then the ones they did . Young people do not often look backwards that way . They remember the good thinks first .  In addition to that in an unsatisfied situation young people are happy again with so little . For example when a child drops his icecream it will start to cry . But as soon as he gets a new one it will not only stop to cry but be happy again and smile . An adult might be thinking about wasting money all day long , about his goofyness and lets the bad occasion erase the good one that he finally has a new icecream .  I can not agress or disagress with the statement as a whole . For me it depends on the atitude of the person . But when it is someone that is looking forward and recognizing his achievements then he enjoys his life more than anyone else .	GER
People start the cycle of learning and understanding from the moment we were born . During the cycle , we discover many things in different ways . While understanding of ideas and concepts can provide us with a basic knowledge of the nature and society that surround us , on the other hand , learning facts gives us the opportunity to feel and experience things that might happen in our life . Both of the ideas are important , but for students , it is more improtant to learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts of a subject .  Firstly , learning facts is more accurate and reliable in many fields of different posts . We can find the answer in crime scene investigation , we do n't know the exact cause of the death of the victim until we open the body and examine it thoroughly . A single substance in the artery may has vital influence to human , but in textbooks , we ca n't find them . The same thoery applies to the teaching of students in school , especially biology , only through a real experiment can they understand the concepts more clearly and correctly .  Secondly , through learning from the facts , students can remember thing more efficiently , the vivid image of the process of how organs work and respond to each other may leave a strong impression on student , which are easier for them to remember rather than the boring contents of the concepts or the textbook . As a high school student myself , my classmate and I both prefer the classes in labs rather than classrooms , they are both exciting and impressive .  Thirdly , in the view emotional development , learning facts can make one 's life more colorful by experiencing and thinking the connections and consequses of how things are organized . Because at the early years of our life , we learn things through facts and experiences . Knowledges we attain at this period are original and pure , they are just the fact , which are more realistic . The more experiences we have , the more calm and objective attitude we can have when faced with an emergency .  As a conclusion , despite that we can get a cut through by learning the concepts that are already proven and given to us , we should still try to find the answers by ourselves .	KOR
Advertisements are seen all over . They catch public attention in newspapers , televisions , billboards . Nowadays advertisements are also seen in cinemas . But I personally feel these advertisements are often exaggerating . Advertisements usually do n't mention hidden costs , do n't mention the efficiency of the product and hence deceive people .  First , the advertisements projected nowadays do not mention about the hidden details they have for a particular product . For example in the master card advertisement the advertisement mainly portrays the advantages like less interest rate , surprise gifts . But they do not mention a detailed information about the product . My friend received a bill for 500 $ just because he crossed the due date , which was not mentioned to him when he bought the card . Moreover for the gifts they give to customers they actually demand money from the customes . Another example about such hidden costs is in the mobile phone industry , last month I got a call from my service provider and they launched a new offer which they mentioned it was free of cost . But when I activated and started using this facility my bill started to shoot up . The service provider did not mention about the usage cost .  Second , the advertisements do not mention about the efficiency of the product . For example , I started using a calculator from a local market . But the calculator did not work for more than two days . It did not respond to several buttons . The advertisement which I referred did not mention about the life of the calculator . Another example is when I bought a blackberry the advertisement said `` Free Bluetooth Headsets For every Blackberry '' . But it failed to work after one month .  Finally , advertisements primarily deceive people . They project the product in a bigger size in televisions but actually the seem to look so small . Moreover they mention that that the entire product is free and once we go and buy they would say that the scheme is under exchange . Several such ways are followed by companies to fool the public .  For the above mentioned reasons , advertisements are depicting an entire wrong picture of the products and tend to exaggerate the product . I personally believe that companies must project correct facts about products .	TEL
I agree with the statement but I have to point out several issues .  I believe times have changed therefore we can not expect young people to behave in the same way as young people from the past did . They might not give enough time to helping their communities but this could be due to a lack of time and different targets .  Nowadays young people are individualistic because we live in a society that focus on individuals rather than on communities . By the same token , young people focus on themselves and they prefer to invest their time in selfish activities instead of community services .  I consider myself a young person and out of my experience I can say that I am not interested in communities at all . Furthermore , I have lived in several countries and what really strikes me is the fact that young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in . For instance , in Sweden guys are extremely independent whereas in Spain are much less independent likewise Spanish guys might care more about communities than Swedish guys do . So in order to understand the question it is needed to place it in a specific context .  The responsible of such situation is the society because society is constructed around individuals , rules are made according to what is the best for individuals thus they became the most important thing . Nonetheless , it is possible to notice strong nationalistic movements in Europe that emphazises on communities . If European communities become strong , it would be a change regarding young people 's attitude hence they would give enough time to helping their communities .  To conclude , I agree with the statement but some aspects need to be considered before talking about young people and their attitude . Young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in and their culture , however , all in all it can be said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Some people , especially sciologists , often discuss whether we will use less cars than today . Although some people may agree with the statement , I disagree with the statement because we have invented useful and high-tech cars , such as hybrid-cars that are not occur air pollution . And during twenty years it is hard to invent new one such as flying cars .  We have invented useful and high-tech cars . It prove the ability of car industy . So , we will be able to drive more useful and high-tech cars . As everyone knows , cars are not always advantageous because they can cause air pollution . However . cars are one of the efficient transportation . For example , now we can buy and drive hybrid cars . It does not make air pollution seriously . I agree with the opinion that it is expensive . However , companys will derease hybrid cars ' price as soon as possible . Because the goverment help them by supporting moneys . In twenty years there will be more cars on the road , also , these cars are definitely hybrid-cars . Or someday we do not have to worry about paying for gas or insurance .  It is hard to invent new one , such as flying cars . We usually watch flying cars in the movies . Hower , it is just movie . We should distingh from fantasy and realty . Twenty years are too short to invent new one . When I was seven years old , I dreamed about trip to the Moon and I believed that I will be able to trip to the Moon after twenty years . Of course , today we can go to the Moon and I heard about news that an American woman visited the Moon recently . I also heard that the expense that astonishing me . In this way , someday there are probably fewer cars than today but not after twenty year . I think that it will takes almost 100years later .  Taking all of things into account , we need more attention and inventory when we want get rid of car on the road .	KOR
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . There are several reasons why this statement holds true .  First of all , people who take risks are usually more adaptable to new situations and feel more secure out of `` their comfort zone '' . For example , when a student from another country decides to move to a new city with a completely different culture , he is allowing himself to experiment new experiences , such as the music , the food , the architecture from that city . This factors do not only enrich his life , but broadens his horizons and allows you to think `` outside of the box '' .  Additionally , when a person tries new things , they put themselves in a more vulnurable state , thus learning from their mistakes and helping them build a stronger , more powerful personality . For example , when a person knows that their options are limitless , and that even if you fail the first time , you are strong enough to try for a second time , their chances for success increases .  Sucess can be described in many different ways . Many people associate sucess with monetary compensation , others with personal satisfaction . Regardless of how success is considered , I believe that taking risk will directly improve your chances to be a succesful person .	SPA
Do you want to live successful life ? If you want to make it possible , I think you 'd better try new things than old things that are too common and oldfashioned . In my opinion , most people who live successfully tried new things and took risks . There are two reasons to express my opinion .  Firstly , it is true that nomal people do nomal things , live nomal lives and love nomal things . According to speaking of successful people , however , they were willing to take risks to succeed . People should not copy and repeat something because sometimes the something need to be changed . We should create new things that will make us live new lives and better lives . Secondly , maybe all of us know ` life is venture ' . It is so famouse sentence that we could hear before . But the case that it comes true is very rare because people are afraid that they could make a mistake in trying new ventures . But I think avoiding venture to keep them from failling is the worst things in your whole lives . You do n't have to be frustrated even though you fail to try something new . It will give you an experience . This envaluable experience will help you to succeed other things . It is so envaluable that you may not want to change to other things .  In conclusion , there are a number of opportunities in the world . Some people can see and cach these possiblities , but others ca n't see that they would miss these things . You have to take these opportunities in your life . In this morden society , it is so important to be a creative person . Society wants that kind of people , so we should have courages and keep going to the new thinsd	KOR
Have you ever seen a boy playing with his toys ? Do n't you think that they are in their own happy world ? I believe that children are extremely more happy than old people .  When we analize old people 's life , there are to many things involve that make them worried . For example , the bills that they have to pay every month , or that boss at work that ask them for more every day . It does n't mean that they do n't enyoy life , because that is life . However , it is too much going on . As much as you know , as much as you are worried .  Children keep their lifes simple , and there is the secret of their success . They can watch the cartoons for hours without worried about what are they going to eat tonight because mom is there to take care of that . Or , they can play with their neighbors all afternoon until they are so tired that it is time to take a nap .  In the adult world , the situation is so much different . Old people still have fun . They can have nice conversations with friends , go to the movies , or have dinner with their family , But there is not the same energy and entusiastic that young people have . Yougn people are more optimistic , positive , because they have a whole life in front of them , so that motivate them to experience new things .  So , in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older , otherwise It would n't be to common listen people saying how much they would like to be a child again .	SPA
Personally I do n't agree with the given statement and I think that if you do what you know and do that well you can be as successful as a risky person .  Todays people are most likely more risky and like to be challengend but this is why they can easily fail . For instance I had a friend who had a very good job as a banker . He had a good position and earned enough money but he wanted to make more out of his life .  He started studying again in another field and had to give up all the little luxuries he was used too ( like his car , old apartment etc . ) Unfortunately that was five years ago and his `` risk '' did n't work out that well . The normal study time would have been four years but during the time he figured out that this field seems not to be the right thing . He developed bad grades and has to retake classes plus when he finally finishes his studies it might be very hard for him to get a good job because the demand in his field went drastically down .  If he would stayed in his old job he could have been the director by now . Another reason for disagreeing with this statement is that I think you should treat all people equal and not judge their success based on the way how they got to a certain point .  For example if it comes to a job offer and there are two people who applied for it I think that the person who worked for years at the same place and has a lot of experience in that specific area might be more successfull than any other person . But I found it very surprising that people oversee those people and are more interested in hiring somebody who has a way more interesting past and took some risks to get there .  On the other side taking a risk might open you new doors that you could n't have had imagined before .  Given those reasons and the choice beween trying new things and taking risks or sticking to familiar behavior I personally think that you can be very successfull either way .	GER
I disagree with the statement that today , Young people are becoming reluctant in helping their communities . I agree that these days , youngsters have started staying aloof , and they have begun to increasingly value their privacy , but this does not mean that they are showing indifference to their communities .  First of all , i believe that it is very important to have faith in the community which the individual has to adhere to , and make contributions to . If a person is fully convinced about the ideals and goals of the community , then he would show full support and cooperation to it .  Recently , i heard a news that a former student of my college was suffering from brain cancer . As soon as this news hit the campus , many student bodies became actively involved in collection funds to succor the patient . Thus , the young students showed great enthusiasm inorder to further a cause which they believed strongly .  Also , in my country , many political parties have special divisions called `` Yuva Shakti '' which are entirely comprised of youth , and which have come into existence only exploit the strength which rests in the young generation . These young men actively support the party principles , and do their every bit to publicise their ideals and objectives . They spend their precious time and effort , to help their community .  Many youth also associate themselves with non profit organizations , in order to help the poor people to get acess to various facilities . For Example , i am a member of a community which aims at increasing awareness among unpriveleged and uneducated people about diseases , their prevention and symptoms etc . We go from village to village in order to spread this valuable information . In the last few years , that i have been a part of this organisation , i have seen a great increase in the number of youngsters willing to join hands for this cause .  There are numerous other instances in which youngsters have been promising , in showing support to the communities they are affiliated to , and so , i believe that they are standing up to the expectations of the society and are still fulfilling their responsibilities very well .

I dont think all of the young people nowadays are helping their communities but i believe some of them do helping . Sometimes this kind of topics appears in the NEWS or the newspaper . Adults thinks young people dont help and playing around but i dont think it is true .  Now in the world , many people are working for theirselves , for family , and for the world but adults say they are not helping but is this true ? i dont think so . there are a hundred of the young people working for the communities . But why adults say that ? maybe because they have not seen it .  How can they show the adults that they are doing for their communities ? do they have to come in front of them and show what they have done ? No . young people nowdays are working and helping their communities in their original styles . Forexample the club DJ . From the adults point of view , they can only see is the young people playing arount untill the morning . but they are working hard in their own style and helping their communities .  if you look around really carefully , then you can see young people nowadays are giving their time to helping their communities in their original style .

I would support this statement . It is logic that advertisements let products look much more innovative und better as it , in fact , really is . Look , if you were an advertisement creator and know innovations for this product , which should be emphasized , the things , which improve the usage of it , you have to focus on it . Let the commercial look like it 's an incredible invention made by the company and this only for the viewer of the ad . It has to be attractive for the consumer , so that he thinks about buying the product .  If there is a advertisement telling me , as a consumer , about the advantages and a lot of other things , I 'd not think much about it , because it 's only one in a million of new things . But by telling me the outstanding advantages , the product could attract me and so led me to a shop to buy it . To reach this point in the mind of people who see this commercial , you have to emphasize the improvements and even let them appear much better than they are in real . You can also use a comparison between the product , which you are advertising for , and another one . By doing this the other product has to perform very bad , while `` your '' one acts normal or even unbelievingly good . Now letting the bad performance seem as the standard before the new advertised product were invented , creates also an overrated image of the new one .  Doing advertisements in this way is the only opportunity to led people to buy this and not another product . It is even the only way for a commercial to get recognized by the audience .  The way how advertisements are made led to the statement that most of the advertisements produced make products seem much more better than they really are .	GER
Nowadays , we are living in an individualism world . In our parents ' period , it was really different , everyone helped everybody . Today this period is revolved . In my opinion , young people do not give enough ti ; e to helping their communities . With several exemples , it will be easier to explain the reason of this phenomenon .  First , young people study longer than before . In average , a student stay at the university around four or five years which is huge compared to 60 's or 70 's . Young people always pretext they no have time to help anybody . Even at 20 years old , we , young people , always have the feeling to be over busy . We have personnal work , group projects work , sports etc but in our plannig , no time for so ; ething else . Well , I say that but we can find time to go to the cinema or meet friends . For exemple , we will prefer going 3 weeks on holidays than staying one week to help a caritative cause . Tere should have another reason of young people careless .  Secondly , as I said previously , we are living in an individual and egoist society . Everyone thinks about him or herselself . Young people believe less in God than before , that could also be a good reason . There is not a lot of religious events . But the religion is a efficient way to gether people around a good cause in order to help other community . And all of it is just the consequence of the environnement of a society or a lack of values , education .  Nowadays parents do not learn to their children to share .  In brief , I think it is not fair but it is a reality , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities but I a ; sure	FRE
The years give us intelligence in most of the times . The statement , yong people enjoy life more than older people no it is alway true , it is depends of the style life , and personal habits .  For exemple , yong people could be always , entusiastic , happy , frendly and also serius , and quiet by the way some yung people can not enjoyed their lives , may be , because their lives culd be no the best experience , in othe words may be they do noy have the oportunity to enjoyed their parents , school , or wherever , in contrast many old people enjoy their laves , most of them thougt that their old it the most beutiful form to accumulate experience , in this way they was have alot of memories and experience .  In my opinion , my grand father is an exemple that the old people can enjoyed life , same or more than the yong people . My grand father is 86 years old and he decided star to lived again , when he was 75 years old , after my grand mather 's dead , some people thougt that he got sad but in contrast , he has decided to write a book , and all weekend he has dancing in a club , he already open his own cantina and recently he has a girlfriend and may be he will married again in a few months . however he has diabetics and hipertencion systemic , he decided enjoyed his life and start again like a second chance . I think that he is a great example for yung people that some times decide to quite their dreams , hopes , and some times their own lives . He is also a good example and a model for me , and I hope enjoyed my life same or more than him .  For this reazon , I am desagree whit the statement yong people enjoy life more than older people do .	SPA
I think we should improve our life right now , so I agree with this statement . I have sereval reasons . First , I think successful pepole can improve the things that is not good , so they should take risky . For example , if they know how to make the computer well , and they do n't take risky to change the computer more convenient and more useful . Now we might not have notebook in our life . Thefore , I think we need take risky to improve our life . On the other hand , some people only make computer only they already do well they ca n't make improve in that computer . There business might goes down . In addition , this is a compitition world , so we need improve . Second , we should make new things that successful people need take risks from that new things . For instance , many people have CD player they have improve to it lightness and useful , but other companies make mp3 player is more useful and lightness . It means this is risks if people do n't like mp3 player , their company might die out . It is a big risks . However , if it success , the business can get richer than before and more famous . In conclusion , I think successful people should try new things not only do what they already knoe how to do well because if they take risks , they can get richer also good for people who live in this world . It mean they can improve things also make useful new things for people .	CHI
Why do young people not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays ? I presume there are several reasons for that .  First of all , young people have increasing possibilities and money to spend their leisure time , so they might rather spend their time enjoying themselves with friends than to be helping the community .  Another reason might be the changing living conditions . People nowadays have to be and are more flexible . The number of young people leaving their hometown to study in a city far away has increased . Young people are changing jobs more frequently than before and thus have to move houses . The time a young person spends in one site has shortened and accordingly the feeling of being a part of a community . Helping a community means to be motivated as you feel responsible for it . Without having spent a certain time in a community your are less motivated to help , as you do not know a lot of people personally . The personal knowledge of people though increases your motivation to help strongly .  The strongest reason for the fact that young people nowadays help less in communities is the changed behaviour towards communities . People have become more individual , more focussed on themselves and their needs . Families as much as communities do not mean as much to people as they used to in the past . People are economically more independent so that they do not need support and help of the communities as much nas in the past .  Taking all those factors into account I would agree that more and more young people tend not to give enough time to helping their communities .	GER
This assey is going to accomplish and reply to the question . Do I agree or disagree to the statement , The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . From my point of view i disagree . I am supporting to travel in a small group , alone or just accompany by my girlfriend .  Their are several reasons to confirm my opinion . At first your are not depending on a timetable the guide offered . I 'd like to plan my traveling on my own . If you stay at a beautiful place , you can keep staying and not to move forward with the group . Within a group there are alway different point of views , some would move faster and some like to stay . You are not flexible . Further a guided tour is always more expensive then a own organized tour . And anyway , with the new internet time and the research possibility , you can find all relevant informations in the internet or guid books like lonely planet gives also all necessary information about sight , cities and historical backround .  As per own experiences you meet a lot of different people from all over the world during the journey . This experience is sometimes more important than the sight itself . You can also get lots of information from other travelers .  Guides are usually visit most famous places and this places are most likely very crowded .  In a nut shell , i 'd like to be more flexible and save money . You never know wheter you like a particular place or not and to spend money to stay at a place I do n't like to only because of a groups decission , this sounds not realy like holiday .  To plan the journey is also a very beautiful experience I	GER
I completely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Every economist today knows that It is so important to know to sell the product , than the cuality of it .  It is well known the huge amounts of money that many enterprises invest in advertisements . There are many stadistical studies about publicity and its effects . For example , they discovered that the effect of advertisements needs some months to produce effect . That is the reason why we can see advertisements about a film that wo n't be in cinemas until 3 months after .  One important thing to consider is that we do n't buy the product , we buy the concept of the product . Sometimes we have proved many products , and we know the cuality of each one , therefore we can chose the better one . But many times we have a lot of products where choose , and we do n't know which is better . Then , if we remmember the advertisement of that product which explain their advantages we probably will choose it , although it really were worse than other .  Some years ago one child ask for a pirate ship toy in Christmas . When he opened the box , and found his present , he started to cry under the surprised looking of their parents . Then the child ask his father where was the sea on which the ship sailed in the advertisement . The child had never seen the sea , and he really wanted it from the toy . This is only an example of the effect of advertisements .  In fact many times we are not buying the product only . We can be buying the image of the product . For example , several marks of clothes are a social distinction .  In conclusion , advertisements are a key factor for sell products , not related	SPA
lots of poeple thinks that young people enjoy life more or better than older people . in one way they are right but in the other hand they are wrong . for a moment lets take the word enjoying life as having fun and doing lots of things .  young people are active because of their age . the age is a big advantage . they have the energy for doing lots of things . for exeple , traveling , riding a bike , running , and sex of course , things most older people dont have much energy to do . and ofcourse they have kids maybe even grand kids to tie them in to the life they currently have . this is maybe their only satisfaction in life . to be able to achieve lots of things that younger people did not achieve yet . because of this satisfaction they maybe have no need to really experience different things .  on the other hand i can not really say that young people can enjoy life much eihter.21st century really does not allow lots of us to explore . with the need of a succesful job ; the need of a diploma appears . with the need of a diploma money comes in to the story . well we all know that we can not grow money on trees so we start working part or full time at an early age . on top of working we have to study in order to graduate . even after all of this the only time we will enjoy life seems like retirement . well again when we retire we are considered older people . so tell me who are the people that really have fun . younger or older people ?  having fun is not about age or activity . it is about being able to enjoy life at its most . we are the ones who determine the term `` enjoying life '' for our selfes . at any age if we are satisfied with what we are doing and who we are and how we interract with people then we are the ones who choses to enjor or not to enjoy .  lets ask this question to our self : TO ENJOY OR NOT TO ENJOY ?

We are living in a modern world filled with advertisements . All advertisements try to show the magic of their products . However , I have little blief in what the advertisements have told me . I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are !  The goal of advertisements determines their poor credit . All the advertisements are aiming to attract as many customers as they can . And how can they obtain this achivement ? They give misleading and uncredible information of their products . For example , some healthy food will claim its body-building function in the advertisement . But few gives any convincing statistical state or trustworthy survey on how it makes effort on people who have used it . We may see a set of comparison between a fat girl and a thin girl . But how can we believe it 's just the effection of the food ? Since advertisements used for commercial use , most of them will not provide sientific proof .  Another interesting phenomena is that famous actresses and actors often appear on the screen to advertise a product . Of course , the actresses and actors are attractive and beautiful . By these kinds of advertisements , we attach the products to these beautiful imagines . But the truth is , how many celebrities really use the products they recomment ? They are just invited to say a sentences , show a pose , and etc . . It misguides the costumer to some extent . Costumers will connect the products to the good imagines in their minds . Actually , the products are not so perfect as the advertisements said or the customer think .  The reason why there exists such a huge gap between the products in the advertisements and in the facts is because there is n't effective norm to regulate advertisements . No specific policy has given to restrict the advertisements . In fact , exaggeration becomes one of the keywords in advertisements . I have already disappointed to find a real product in any advertisement . Only when our goverment and media realize the importance to supply the audiance unbiased and true facts instead of the beautiful lies in advertisements , can we choose the products without doult following the instruction of advertisements .  So , when you choose something to buy , do not trust what the advertisements told you . Turn off the television when you see an unblievable product in an advertisement again . A clever customer should try to evaluate and judge a product by him/herself .	CHI
The issue of wether young people enjoy life more than other people meet agrate debate in the mean time . Young people has ambition , the look to the future , the ability to get new informations about technology as life is widley opened for them to gain experiance and learn a new cultural , scientific , and social thems . they have the health and capability to enjoy differant programs for intertanment , has the chance of getting new ferands and relationship and keeping them . but do they have enough support or backup to help them achieve what the like to do . foe examlpe ayoung couple may like to get along vacation from work to travel to anew country to enjoy their love and life but they have not onough money as they are in their beginig of emloyment life , morover vacations may affect their promotions , on the other hand they are responsable for other people for examlpe they have to take care of their parents or kids . Alot of young people have shortage of intertament facilities for finnetial reasons or they have to obey other persons who is sponsoring them . The youg are under tension and pressure of life and not had the enough experance to take over problems On otherhand older people have alot of relationships with freinds , colleagues family members as sons or grand sons who support them and take care of them , in addition to gainig of properties through life and finential independance . but some of them might get health problems which most of them are controlable now , older couple for example can enjoy themselves with no worrey about somebody else alot of them beleive that what is going to happen let happen or let go . so not care much about futur .  An old man once said the life is composed of three sections first thirty years of life aman has health and enjoy his jop as he has somthing to do in life but not too much resposnsbities and he has enough time to spend for leisurers and entertament but he dosenot have money to acheve his wishes .  Second thirty years aman has health , money but he had to work hard to carry on his sucesse but he dosnot have enough time . The later life thre are the time and money but no health .  But in summary I thought i have enjoyed my life when i was young by alot of things mainly freindship , passion and love . all with experancing of establishment of a family of our own and how happy we where , but i think We are bit older now and we feel life worth to live in and enjoy relationships , work , belongings .

Considering the population of the world today and distribution of income rates among countries , it is hard to give an immidiate answer to the question about the number of cars in use in twenty years ' time . Let me brirefly state why I have chosen to emphasize an ambiguity instead of an exact answer .  First of all , the population of the world is growing rapidly which might create the impression that there would be more cars in use as there would be more people living on earth . It is true for the case of Turkey for example . I came to observe that automobile galleries in Turkey are the best profit makers and also the number of cars sold increases dramatically each year . But taken from another aspect , it could quite be the opposite . The rapid growth of population is observed more in underdeveloped or developing countries whose gross national product or income per capita is very low . Then it would be more likely for the citizens of such countries to tend to use buses or trains which would be a much cheaper way of transportation . In India for instance , one can easily notice this situation .  Secondly , the increase in the number of people living in a city might push its dwellers to make use of public transportation . Not because that these people can not afford to buy cars but because that they do n't want to lose their valuable time on roads , stuck in the middle of a never-ending traffic jam . Let 's take the example of New York City . Even the mayor of this city is said to be using the subway in order to evade from the traffic and promote the use of subways . Yet there is also the case of California where we can see anyone at any age to own and drive a car . Because of its geographical characteristics , it is almost impossible to live one 's life without a car in Los Angeles . Not that the city is overcrowded such as New York . But because there are miles in between any two destinations .  As to my personal observations , there are a body of reasons both to agree and disagree with the statement . In the end , whatever the sings and predilictions are , we live in a world of unpredictibility and suprises . Who knows wheter a genious scientist would come up with a more time and energy saving invention than a car , or not ?	TUR
Taking risks is the only way to improve our knowledge and to succeed in life . keeping this in view i would like to agree with the statement that successful people try newer things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this may include many aspects like inventing many things , knowing other side of coin or the other solution of problem .  firstly , take the point of inventing new things the inventors who would discover a new thing couldn , t either know whats the result is going to be its a saught of risk that is taken by them . but what if they are suceeded inventing that then there will add some more glory to them instead of just sitting quite simply because they already have done well and fearing about the risk they has to take .  after all , FAILURES ARE STEPPING STONES TO SUCCCESS '' .they may learn a new thing by failure which will be definitely useful again .  secondly , take the point of finding other solution to the existing problem . If the Indian president A.P.J.Abdul Kalam could not have risked the launch of rocket into space people could not knoe the information of what actually hapens in other planet or the interesting points about space that we know now . thogh it was a failure for the fiorst time he did not stop there and followed the saying `` try and try until you succeed '' which broght him graet fame .  Thirdly , consider the case of invention of many metals by scientists which is invented by the experiments which risked their life itself . but those people are more successful in life because they had the fame and importance even after their period .  these people did not do what they already know how to do well . infact , they risked their lifes for the discoveries they have done .  Finally , i conclude by saying that each and every individual should always risk on doing new things which will definitely yield better result .	TEL
Now a days the young people do not devote their enough time for helping their communities which they should do . A youngster should always help his community because they are the one 's who will help him if he will have any problem . They safeguard the youngsters .  From my point of view , the young people are not devoting sufficient time to the community . Instead of this they like to party with their friends . Some utilise their time in studying and tutions . Some find playing games interesting rather than providing support to their community . The have now a days no feeling in their heart which the people in the past used to have for serving their community . They are unaware of the fact that the community is the one who is going to help them when in need . He should therefore work for it to take his community to great heights and create a level for it i.e a separate entity . For example - MohanDas Karamchand Gandhi was not called the Father of India like that only . He had suffered a lot in freeing his country from the Britishers who were ruling it for many years . He did not did this all alone . Slowly and steadily he gathered Indians to support him and carried out several movements to rule them out . At last his country gained freedom on 15th August , 1947 after struggling for a few decades . The young one 's should therefore wake up from their sleep and help in strengthening freedom . The should not leave it at the stake . Thus , the youngsters view should always be on helping their community as GURU NANAK did for the Sikhs .  Therefore the primary function of every people belonging to a particular community is to have the potential to do whatever his community requires from him . He should serve his community as best as he can .	HIN
Everyone wants to enjoy life and live happily . We are all different and can not be same in appearances and preferences . As industry develops , people get more chances to enjoy their life in various ways . For example , before invention of airplane , taking travel around the world was not easy as nowdays . But we have a lot of things to do in our free time . Therefore , some people might say that young people in these days enjoy life more than older people do . It is true in some aspects because young people have more alternations for enjoying life and many leisure equitment have been inventing gradually .  I thinks that enjoyment of life does not mean the physiclal aspects always . Of coure , youth itself is a beautiful one . In other hands , we should plan our future life and plan to prepare for that in our young days . Older people enjoy their life with a sound wisdom of living . They have experienced many things through life and have a wise sight for life and world .  Being young is not a critical fact for enjoying one 's life . Older people can enjoy their life in more various ways with their experiences of life and open eyes for others .	KOR
Some people can have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , other people can specialize in one specific subject . I agree with that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .  First , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects helps people think widely . When we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we can convine them in various ways . We can think more carefully about possibilities .  Second , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects helps people cooperate with each other . We can know about each other more . We have to help others .  Third , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects help people look many diversities .  In three reasons , I agree with that It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .	KOR
Different ways of learning can be taught by a professor or lecturer in order to make it easier for their students to memorize certain study matters . Some believe , that trying to help their students to understand ideas and concepts is more important than just learning facts .  To begin with , encouraging students to develop their own ideas and concepts about a certain topic and in the end to draw a conclusion , is very likely to have a positive aspect on the student 's memory . For example , if a student in a history class has the task to think about the way the Geman people must have felt at the end of the Second World War , and s/he works out their feelings of desperation and hopelessness , s/he has learned through experience .  Moreover , through having understood certain ideas and concepts , a student can basically transfer them to nowadays situations and as well to another subject or theme . For instance , having learned the concept of social behaviour on a specific example and having understood the idea of it , the student will be easily able to observe the social behaviour , its causes and consequences , in his/her own environment and to compare them to other unsocial behaviour and the way it differs in every country and continent .  Learning facts surely has its disadvantages in specific exam situations . For example , if a student is beeing asked about when certain historical events took place . Especially in the subject of history , learning dates by heart is rather important , mostly in order to avoid getting mixed up with situations that happened before another event and to recieve a basic overview of certain periods of time .  All things considered , there are more benefits for students , not only in school but for the entire life , to beeing able to use learned ideas and concepts in a variety of fields than to learn facts that can be easily forgotten just after the exam has finished .	GER
I fully agree with this statement . Young people donot give enough time to helping their communities . They mostly indulge in activities that they want to do or having things they desire , instead of looking at the problems affecting their homes and localities .  I myself , being a young person and living alongwith numerous other fellows in a hostel , has lots of experiences of such neglect shown by young individuals towards social and community needs . Most of the time being spent by young people goes mainly in fun activities like partying , gaming , chatting etc. or either in studying , preparing for the exams . There seems to be no thought processes in the mind that deals with the immediate difficulties , shortages or problems that is going aroung the place which need to be solved .  For example , in our institution there is a major problem of standing water bodies in and around campus which provides a typical breeding ground for mosquitoes that can cause dangerous infections to the ocals living in and around the area . But inspite of this , there seems to be no concern shown by the students who themselves might be affected by it . The situation can grow worse if not taken seriously . Effective measures can be applied with the help of young students if they are willing .  Similarly , there are issues like education of poor workers and their children , who work in the campus for construcion of new buildings . Young students can really help such poor people by organizing free weekly or monthly classes within the area and it could be of great help to the children who can think of having a much better life in future . But till now , nothing has been done by the young people living here .  Young people mostly dont listen to the advices given by seniors or the elderly people . They always do what they feel is right . Spending time to help communities is not the popular choice in their minds . Going by what I have seen in my campus hostels , most of young people , including me , like having fun , go to bars and restaurants , have nice unending chats or just study the curricular courses and interest related subjects . Spending time for social and community services is not there nowadays among the young people .	HIN
I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Advertisements are produced to promote a product and to make it sell better . So what do we do if we want people to buy our product ? We try to tell them that our product is the best choice on the market , which is maybe not true , but people need to believe it to chose our product . That is the reason why many advertisements make to seem their products much better than they actually are . In our every day lives we are confronted with many examples . My favourite example are the washing powder advertisements on television . Would n't it be wonderful to put your clothes in the washing machine and when taking them out again , all the ugly stains are gone and the clothes look newer than before ? I have tried several times , but it just does not work . So there the advertisements definitely make the washing powder much better than it is . Another product which has to be incredible according to advertisement , are energy bars for sports . You do not only get an unhuman power and condition , but the bar turns your outer appearance into an athlete 's body . `` This is much cheaper than the fitness studio '' , I thought and tried . But again I was disappointed . Neither did my condition improve , nor did my body shape change . Disillusioned about advertisements promises I resigned , until recently , when I heard Ovomaltine 's new publicity . The advertisement of the chocolate powder to flavour your milk , does not claim to make you stronger , but more enduring . It says : `` Ovomaline - not better , but longer . '' So this is the one and only exception I have seen in my life , where advertisement does not make a product seem much better than it is .	GER
Nowadays , young people are more involved in many activities than in the past . For this way , someone can adfirm that young people do n't give much time to help their communities . Because of I 'm a young person , I can explain my opinion and I can support my disagreeded opinion with some examples . The first example I support , is that young people have not so much time to help their communities because they do n't wont to help them , not because they have n't such time : in fact , I can help my friends if he ask my an hand , even if I have to study for myself . If I am beloved to a friend , I help him in every way . But in this way , I have to renounce to spend some time to play the computer or to have a pause , going to commercial center , or runnig , for example . I supposed that the people that said this sentence , know just selfish people , that think just to their life . But in university , for example , students live together much time : they stay at the same lessons , they spoke in pauses times , they have a lunch togegher and they become as a family . In a family , if a member has a problem , the others help him . And in this way occur in university . In fact helping each together can consent to pass more simply the exams , and live the university life with no fear . Also in family young people help fairly well ( and more than sometimes or seldom ) : in fact as a young person grows , his responsability grows itself and he recognize that helping parents is important . They can do it in different ways : working in speare time , to learn some money to spent for their personal object , and they do n't ask money to their parents , or cleaning the house or their own room . Naturally , exist many of young people that do n't help in none of this way their family , but I ca n't generalize . As the man who said that sentence can not generalize .	ITA
I agress that it is more important for students to understand idras and concepts than itis for them to learn facts . First , If students can understand ideas and concepts , they will utilize them . Understanding them make students more better . For example , students understanding them can make thier opinion useful . In addition to , understanding ideas and concepts is more eassier than learning facts . Because , If students were able to understand them , maybe , They can not forget them . But learning is not .  Secondly , To larn facts is difficult . For example , if students try to remember facts , they might spend more time than understanding the ideas and concepts . We should save our life 's time .  If students learn facts , they might forget them . This is poor activies . Third , learning facts is not cheeper than understanding ideas and concepts . If we try to learn facts we pay the fees . And if we choose to understand ideas and concepts , we can understand alone . For example we can read books . Reading books is useful in understanding ideas and concepts .  Learning facts is unuseful ways to gain knowleges . we should gain knowleges . So , we can get a job . Getting jobs is very difficult . The world economic is unclearly because of high oil prices , weaken dolloar and so on .  Therefore , possibly , I recommend understanding ideas and concepts . If I could back to the past , I would understand ideas and concepts . I never could learn facts . Because I do not have little time . Time is money .  Remember my word . so your children will be happy .	KOR
At first glance it seems to be a baffling question but if you 'll take a closer look you might reckon to say that this subject needs to be examined . This esssay deals with a broad description of why it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .  First of all I would like to say that it is indispensable for any kind of student to broaden his knowledge . Let us assume that you earned your Bachelor 's degree in sports and that you would like to get some overseas working experience . Due to the fact that you attended a univerity that did n't allow you to learn a foreign language it wo n't be possible for you to fully indulge in new surroundings .  Furthermore you can just work in a small working field that does n't allow you obtain more responsibility . I am quite sure that you will soon feel uncomfortable and that you might regret that you did n't take the opportunity to broaden your academic skills . Rome was not build in a day and it is quite apparent that you can hardly obtain more knowledge from one day to another .  If those students who just focussed on a specific subject , such as sports , attended different classes , besides their major , it would be easier for them to survive in the capitalistic world .  I am trying to reinforce my point of view with a quotation of Darwin . '' The survival of the fittest '' , expresses a fact , based on several incidents that took place in the early 19th century . You can easily link it to our assigment .  Thus , what happens to those students who attended business classes besides their normal major . Let us assume that they have learned how to plan tasks and how to meet their targets via shedules and agendas . Maybe these business classes taught them how to control people via '' carrot and stick '' or through normal philanthroposy .  These skills would truly broaden their possibilities to apply for other jobs , such as managing sports events or leading an enterprise in the fields of sports . I am pretty sure that everybody takes advantage of a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , as I 've examined in the lines above . I grew up with the belief that a person never truly finishes his education and that there is something new to learn with each day . Referring to my introdcution it is vital to succedd academically due to these hints .	GER
We are facing thousands of advertisements in our life . They are easy to say `` nothing is better than this '' . However are they all true ? I do n't think so . They do ` over-advertising ' the product than the real ability of it .  First , i declare most advertisements make goods seem much better than they are because of my experiences . Last year , i had really long black hair but my hair condition was not good so that i decided to make my hair healthier . At that time , a ran into some advertisment with a very attracitive woman and her hair looked like silk . What i felt that time was , if i use that product i would have facinating hair like that woman 's ! I used it for a long time but i could n't have had a silky hair like that woman . First i was depressed , but than i began to think , that 's what advertisers do . ` Over-advertising ' .  Moreover , in my opinion there is resonable reason that the company has to over-advertising .

some one has ver rightly said , `` it is not the destination that matters , but it is the journey thats the real adventure '' it is not only the destination that you should enjoy you should also enjoy the fun of reaching there , which can only be done in a group . travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best possible way to travel . when you travel in a group you have more fun and you end up doing a lot of activities that you would not do if your travelling alone .  Man is a social animal and we always like it if we have some one to talk to and some one with whom we can we can share our emotions . when travelling in a group , you have this chance . for instance is you go to an old church and you are in awe at its beauty and archetecural design having some one there with whom you can share these feelings always feels nice .  Secondly , having a tour guide is major advantage when it comes to travelling around in a new city . as the guide is famaliar with the city and the tourist spots in that city . he is the right person who can show you around the city and take you to the right places . if you were to do it alone it would take you hours just to figure out how to go from one place to the other .  Thirdly , travelling in a group is a lot of fun , as you are never alone and are always with some one , playing chatting or doing something fun . also travelling with people makes you try new things which you would never do on your own . for example if someone in your group likes adventure sports , seeing him the other peole in the group would also get motivated to try their hand at it . you might never know someone might actually turnout to be very good at it .  Thus we see that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much more fun and adventurous . eventhough the tour guide might charge you some extra money , but he covers it up with the fact that he saves a lot of your time and helps you relax on your holiday as he is taking care of everything . travelling in a group helps you have a holiday in the true sense of the word and lets you enjoy to the fullest .

In these modern times , youth are always bothered about achieving thieir individual goals and fullfiling their needs . They are less bothered about their community . Every youth has to play a certain role in the community . He has to serve for the benefit of the community and future generations .  Often , Youth benefit from a communtiy and when they achieve their goal or reached a better situation with the aid of the community , they forget the help rendered to them . For example in developing countires many students are provided reservations because they belong to a certain downtrodded community . The students after achieving success are not indebted to the community and dont try to help it .  But there are some instances where this is not always true . Consider the case of an Indian student going to the United States to pursue higher education . He checks out the memeber 's of the Indian community in that college and contacts them before hand . The members of the community then arrange for his transport from the airport to the university campus and then take care of him for two to three days . Since the basic idea of this community is to help other students and in this aspect young people are suceeding .  There are also several youth who try to help their communities . When a person leaves his country and achieves success , they do not forget their mother land , they try to help their native community . Take the case of many Non Resident Indians . These young people try to help and fund various charity organisations in India .  So , though i agree that young peole now a days are not giving enough time to help their communities , I feel that this is not always true because there are some instances where young people spend their time and money for the benefit of the community .

Travelling is one of the most effective ways a family or an individual could spend quality time , relax or have fun . Therefore it is essential that tourists have their vacations orgainised so that they can have the largest amount of fun possible . To have a perfectly a orgainised vacation , people should travel in a group led by a tour guide .  There are many benefits to travelling with a tour guide . Firstly , the tour guide is a trained professional in tourism . He would know which are the best attractions to visit , and what would be an appropriate length of time to spend at each one . He would be able to plan how to spend the whole day effeciently , unlike if a person was alone and has to spend hours deciding where to go next . Secondly , the tour guide would have tickets ready prior to the visit , and this would enable the group to go straight to the attraction without wasting time . For example , to go up the Eiffel Tower in Paris , France , it would , on average , take a person 2 hours to get a ticket in the high season . However a tour guide would get you the ticket well before you arrive there , and then you would n't have to waist a lot of time waiting in line . Thirdly the tour guide would arrange all the transport in advance , and for example would make arrangment with bus companies to have busess present at the correct times , and tell them exactly where to go . If , on the other hand , a person is travelling alone , he would waste a lot of time trying to get from place to place .  There is also a social benefit to traveling with a group , as it would be likely that your group consists of people mainly from your home country , and therefore you would be to socialise with them and discuss the attractions you visit , along with the fact that you make new friends .  However , some people may argue that having a tour guide deprives them from making their own decisions , and their personal choises . Also , it would not allow them to do things that they have always wanted to do , if they visted a certain country , but this can always be easily solved by extending the vacation a day or two , or if that is not possible , missing the certain guided tours they are not particularly interested in .  All in all , I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . It 's advantages significantly overwiegh its disadvantages , and I beleive that most people would have more fun if they travelled in group led by a guide .	ARA
I disagree to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .  Frankly speaking , what people with a guide can understand is only the surface of the country . I think feeling and knowing the different way or value is the most interesting thing in travelling . And it can be achieved only by voluntary actions . In that meaning , not all but many travels with tour guides miss the chance to enjoy the travel .  First , generally the trip with a tour guide is easier to get information or knowledge of the country you go . You do n't neither have to buy a guide book nor collect the information from internet before you leave . Even though you have n't done those things , the tour guide will tell you all you want to know , such as good restaurant , exiciting amusement park or beautiful site . Without a tour guide you have to do all of these thing by yourself , so you can get well understanding thorough this action .  Second , feeling and knowing different ways can be achieved by knowing the native people . But there are less chance to get along with them by tour trip . There are less free time in tour because the guide scheduled most of the time . Moreover with a lot of people who are same nationality have less chan	JPN
This is very difficult question for me , because I am a one of the young people who do not have a relation with my community , so I copletely agree with this opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . There are several resons I think for this question .  First , almost young people do not know their neighbours , because there is no opportunity to contuct with them . In the past of Japan , people did anything with the community members , because the people who belonged to same communitiy were families , so people decide the important things , like a rebuilding the house or changing the job , with the communities . People do help the others in their communities . However , people nowadays are not interested in others , and they do not want to have a relation with the neighbours , because the horrible actidents occures recently .  Second , older families and younger families have a generation gap . If there is a chance to do something together in their communities , but both families have a different opinions . It is a natural thing for the people , because they tend not to have a complex problem , so they do not give enough time to helping the communities and not have a relation .  When I was a child , I had to clean up the park where I always played with my friends for the community 's event . This was a task for the children . Many adult observed us , but another day , many adult taught sports for the communitiy club . I agree with this opinion that many young people do not give the time for their communities , but we should change this custom to improve the relationship between the neighbours and me , because if the accidents happens in daily life , others near us help first . People help each other and get a good relationship in the communities .	JPN
i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it has lot of advantages like u do n't need to be panicked in a foreign country , the tour guide will direct you to all worth sight seeign places and provide you the background information about the same .  the comfort and security offered while travelling with a group is better than travelling on your own . . u build new friendships and see different facets of life . moreover the cost of the trips are realtively less since most of the guides/operators have tie ups with diffrent resorts , transportation companies etc . .. it gives a better deal for the consumers . your trip is organized and any problems arising can be dealt by the guide since he is a seasoned and experienced in the trip .  However , there are few disadvantages even . we may/may not get individual attentions during the trip by the guide . if he has many tourists under him . sometimes a consumer may also feel that he is not gettign a raw deal i.e. not a good deal and its expensive because the tour operators margin ( commision ) will be added to the package costs .  Immaterial of the disadvantages , i feel that the best way to travel is ina group led by a guide since you tend to enjoy more and any hassles realting to foreign exchange visas etc are dealt with effectivey etc . .

Today , we live in a society that offering more and more oppurtunity than to pass . today , more young studying untill to 25 years old and so we travel for go to the university . This broke more time in the day .  For example , I live in Como but I study in Milan , so everyday I must trevel from Como to Milan and I spend 2 hours of time ; and in the week-end I prefer to go enjoy myself or stay with my parents or my boyfriend .  But 30 years ago , there was not this : a lot of young worked or in a factory or in a family ' hause and there wsa a stron regolament like go to the church every day , helping the old people and serving the comunity .

I , being a student for 12 years now , feel able to juge and talk about the scholar system and in my opinion our scholar system concentrates too much on succes than on values .  There are a lot of different subjects and classes you are participating as a student and in every class you are writing exams . But often you do not have enough time to study for such an exam and therefore you just learn the most important facts by heart to succeed in the exam . But you forget the facts you learned by heart very quickly and after a few months nothing is left anymore and you take only a minimum of what you have ever learned at school with you . This is not a very good preparation for life because at school you often only learn how to reproduce facts about a topic in a few days .  By practicing ideas in an enjoyable way like in group work or role plays for example you keep the essence and the main contence of a concept in mind . That way you do not have to feel under pressure to learn facts very quickly by heart , you can enjoy learning ! And if you enjoy learning you will take more essence with you .  Teaching concepts and ideas may content ideal ways of behavior you could never teach with the help of facts . Students can learn about values and strategies that are important for their future life . If they understand the background or the concept of something they learn they will always be able to reproduce these strategies of behavior in daily situations . And in my opinion this is the task of school .  School should prepare all of the students for their future . It is up to a school to teach values and virtues because very often parents fail . It is sure that values can not be taught by giving facts or by learning things by heart . Values can only be taught by practicing them and therefore I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .	GER
`` People try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what theyalready know how to do well '' i agree with this statement because taking new things we can learn a lot adn become famous in what we are doing . By trying new thing we can know some thing new and discover new things . For some people after taking a lot of risk they may not get success and so they go on with there same work . I dont agree with this statement because with out trking new thing we can not move forward . For example : if the country is a developing country it remains a developing county for ever if they dont try new thing adn make there country a developed country .  Another example , if a person wants to become a top ranker or become an engg he need to take a lot of risk to reach his destiny , by trying different thing , thinking different and working on it . I think it will definetly gives sucess to the person .  An example for wich i disagree the statement , if a person is not working hard or not trying anything different , then definetly he will not reach is goal and he can not he a successful person . Similarly take sachin tendulkar , he was very poor in studies adn was verymuch intrested in cricket . His fater took a lot of risk and started practising him cricket rather than giving coaching in this regular studies . So because of taking lot of risk and trying new thing now we got a world class cricketar , and india is very proud to have such a player . So this all happend just nothing but taking risk and trying new things rather than countinuing this known work .  So finally i say , `` the people who try different and like to take risk rather than doing the same work will definitly get sucess and stand on top of all '' .	TEL
we can always listen some old person that is not delight with the behaviour of young people . often old person says that young people are change , are very different to people of their time . these changes can be find in all aspect of our life .  nowdays young people have always a lot of things to do , so i agree with the statement . nowdays young people have often a very busy life . almost all people of 19-25 years go to university and sometimes they work too . infact work during the week is often a possible solution to resolve economic problems but at the same time it allow them to attent at school . then they play different kinds of sports , they want to go out with their friends they also want to have time to relax at home . so they do not have any time to helping their comunity or to do some social and useful activities . if i look for between all my friends i think that only a small part of them reserve part of their time to help comunities . i do not think that it 's a right behaviour but i think it depends on our society also . the most important values of our society seem to be our carrer , to enjoy , to have a relaxed life . most people do not consider to importance of helping people who live worse .  even if i recognized the importance of these aspects i can also say that it is very difficult , also for me , manage to concetrate on these kinds of people . i do not have enough free time : i have to study , i have to go to university , i have to go to work in the weekend or i have to clear my house ( i has been living alone for 3 years ) and so if i have free time i prefer going to shopping , or to the cinema . i do not think this is a good reason but	ITA
I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The purpose of the adverstisements is to convince people to buy the products in a shot time . In the modern world there are so many messages trying to catch the attention of the people that reaching this goal is not easy . The advertisement has to be really effective in order to being read and to drive the purchaising behavior . Overstating the functionalities of the product can be a mean to reach this goal .  If we think to some advertisements and to the related products it 's easy to find the differences between the picture and the descriptin of the product and the product itself . That means that we are aware of the `` overstating techinque '' used by the advertisers and that we do n't fully believe in the messages that they convey . I never expect the kitchen 's cleaning soaps to clean my kitchen as they do in the advertisements ! And I never expect the breakfast 's biscuits to have the perfect shape they are showing on every paper pages an during every commercia ! We are all used to adopt a certain `` discount ratio '' while evaluating the advertisements messages . The difficult think for advertisers is to balance the reality with the overstatement in their advertisements because if the messages are too distant from the reality the risk is loosing the client after the first try of the product .

Having a specific knowledge of a subject is definitely helpful for our careers . However , knowing a broad knowledge can broaden our horizon and inspire us . So , what should people choose ?  For a human being , children or teenagers should receive as much as different kwoledge from different subjects as they can . Because from taking various classes , they can explore and understand the world more . Which can assist them learning how to live in this diversitive world . Also from that , they can get some ideas about their interests and which subject they are good in . Because of that , they can plan for their future and life .  For aldutes , they should learn in particaular subjucts which can help them for their jobs . As new knowledges is being explored everyday . If their ability can not fulfill the requirements for their jobs or the society , they will be kicked out or abundant very soon .  For improving their ability and completing from others , they should concentrate in specific subjects .  Different people have various needs . To determine learning a wide knowledge or concentrate in particular subjects is totally base on the personal need . There is no absolute answer .	CHI
In my opinion , I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than the other . The reason why I prefer this one is that if someone is specialized in one specific subject , I think this person is quite boring person . Lets say he knows very wel about the animals in the sea and whenever you meet with them . He talks only about things that he is good at and nothingelse . As I am a listener of him , I would have very boring time .  On the other hand , if you know broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people who talked with thinks that you are very smart . You dont have to talk that much but little bit of information about many things . Thats all you need . Usually listeners dont try to argue with you , unless they are professioners of what you are talking .  Of course It is also good to specialize in one specific subject . Especially if you are teacher or doctor , anyone who teach or give advices . Then the one specific subject would be very valuable .  Actually both personalities are valuable and better than knowing nothing because you know something at least . I had one friend who was usually quiet . But when I let him talk about cars , he didnt stop talking untill I changed the topic . He was so interested in cars and he likes to spent his time for cars .	JPN
It depends on the situation , but there are a lot of situations that people should learn facts not just understand them . There are two examples that support may opinion . One situation is when you play soccer . How well you study soccer rules or techniques , you ca n't play it very well because you need experience of real games . Many pro soccer player especially from Brazil played soccer without reading text books in their childhood . They just played soccer for fun . Many of them did n't study phycics around the boll .  The other is when you drive a car . In my case , I studied about car engineering for one month and I thougt I had enough knowlegde of car . However , when I drove a car first time , I coud n't drive it well . I think that to understand idea is not enough .  So the most important thing is to learn something by using their bodies not only using brains . Indeed there are some cases that you need to understand ideas and concepts , but you can get that kind of knowledge when you learn it .	JPN
Helping a community is a noble act . And I also agree that youngsters today do not give enough time to help their own community . But it can not be completely attributed as lack of concern from the young people . There are several reasons for this .  The primary reason is that with so many activites going on parallelly in young people 's lives - studies , projects , assignments and other more important commitments that they are left with very little time for themselevs . And so they prefer to concentrate that little time left in their hobbies or some other personal activities rather than helping their communities .  With the advent of television and other media 's which has revultionised our lives , we are concerned so much more with what is happening around the world that we actually forget the problems immediately surrounding us . One of my neighbour 's is addicted to this one sitcom , which is played everyday night that he actually leaves all his pending work and religiously watches the show . Such is the impact of television on today 's generation .  Also there is a growing trend among youngsters especially among the college goer 's that such activities are uncool and out of vogue . So some students deliberately avoid helping a community even if it is against their conscience , just to show that they are cool . To be frank , i myself have witnessed this during my junior college years .  This kind of thinking which is actually much more prevalent among the youngsters in the urban area 's needs radical change . It is really a shame that youngsters today consider such noble acts as cheap and uncool .  But there are some people in each community who after all this things , dedicate some time to such work .

In our century , advertising is everywhere . We have to deal with and to be aware of adverstisement 's tricks . To my mind , most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .  Indeed , the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product . That is why they are ready to say everythings which can convince you to buy it . People who do advertisement have not the due to say the truth , their goal is only commercial , not educative . So how can we trust adversting ? To illustrate this fact , we can take the example of Mc Donalds . If we look an adverstisement for this restaurant , we can learn that meals are usually very dietetic , they are not bad for the health and pictures of meals are really teasing . But according to the experience make on Mc Donalds ' food in Supersize me , we can see that , this food is not good for the health .  To give another example , we can considerate make up advertisement . Women who plays in these advertisments are models and if we put this make up , we will not looking at the model . Moreover , on her rimmel seems to be something very efficient but on we it does not have the same effect ! So the product work better on TV or on adverstisement than on the real life . It is usually the same for washing products which wash our clothes more white than white .  We have to keep in mind that : advertising world is an i ; aginary world where everything is perfect . That is not supposed to reflect the reality . That sells we dream and that is what we buy when we buy a product after have seen it advertisement . Indeed all is facke on an advertisement , people on are retouching , they always seem happy , and think everything is delicious or amazing .  To conclude we can say that , yes adverstisement makes usually products better than they really are because there main stake is to sell something and not to be true .	FRE
Although young people tend to have more phisical advantaged to enjoy life than older people , I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people because of the following reasons .  First , older people have more free time because they are retired . On the other hand , young people are busy in going to schools , doing assignments , and working to support their life . For example , now I am attending at a law school and I spend most of my timer for preparing claases . Also , I do some part time job because I need money to socialize . However , my parents are retired and they spend most of their time to go to travel , plan for trip , and so on .  Second , older people tend to have enough budget to enjoy their life . For example , my parents love traveling and they went to Peru and West Europe last year . I also like traveling abrod , but I do not have enough money , so I ended up traveling domesticly by renting a car and staying motels .  Third , older people are more likely to have concrete object regarding what they want to do in free time because there were many things they could not do when they were working as a result of insufficient time . For example , my father 's dream was to visit Peru which he could achieve because he was unable to get enough long vacation to go to abroad .  It is true that young people are more healty and some older people can not do what they want because they can not move . There are , however , many oder people who are organizing poem clubs or reading clubs and enjoying their life regardless of their immovability .  In conclusion , older people are enjoying their life much more than youg people because they have more free time , more financial resources , and have stroger desire to do something they could not do when they were young .

I think that there are a lot of young people which give a lot of time to helping their communities and therefore I disagree with the statement and I can give some reasons and a lot of examples .  Nowadays in Italy there are a lot of people which do civil service . It is a public no-profit organisation that does a lot of free services for the community and the people , which work in it , are often young men or women . In addition there are many private organisations which do not have financial aid from the state and where people work without any wages . In these organisations there are also a lot of young people .  I can state this because I have some friends and my girlfriend too which do it and I admire a lot for their choice . For example my girlfriend works as a volunteer in a first aid organisation and I know that a lot of services are done by it as healthcare to the elderly people or first aid when an accident occured and wounded people must be saved .  Furthermore it is very common to view young people in these organisations when there are sport or music events . In fact , when there is in my city a football match , there are very often young people in first aid organisation , which is always present in these cases .  Although I admire this choice and I would like to do it I can not do because I have a very hard university and so I do not have much time for beginning this activity .  In conclusion because of many examples that I did in this essay , I can affirm that I disagree with the statement of the question and I can state that a lot of young people give time to their communities .

Nowadays advertisements have a big impact on our lives . They can be very infuencial on our decisions and choices related to the our shops . We can find them everywhere , on television while we are watching a movie or a show , on newspaper , on internet and also on the streets . Sometimes when we open our mail box we find a lot of advertisements about for example restaurant and shops .  Not always what they tell describe the real qualities of a product . In fact I think that often they make products seem much better then they are . Sometimes for example we buy a product because we have heard so much about it and its incredible properties but latter when we use it we realize that we have been stupid .  In fact the product quality does not corrisponds with the description in the spot and furthermore we have problably spent more buying it instead of a similar product which was not advertised .  In particular I believe that these advertisement are more powerful with children . In fact they usually ask their parents to buy a game or a pair of shoes because they have seen them on television , they have been attracted by the presentation of this product and they really believe that they can reproduce what is showed on these advertisements .  In conclusion I think that it is better to be a little doubtful when we see these spots . When we buy a product we have to be carefull because sometimes a common product which we have not ever see before can shows the same properties and qualities of the one which is advertised . We will problably save money .	ITA
Opinions might exists over whethe most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . Personally , I agree with the above statement because advertisements are a method to maximize companies profits . As well , the time for advertisements is dramatically short .  To start with , the purpose of making advertisements is to attract their customers . Today 's society , many companies exist , and many products are made by them . As a result , the companies tend to draw people to buy their goods . In this sense , advertisements are one of the best way to increase selling rates . to illustrate , everyday , people are surrounded by the numarable number of advertisement . To hold the people 's attention , the functions of goods in advertisement are different with original functions of it . My mother is a case in point . She often suffers from bad flu and buy medicine after watching medical advertisements . However , she always failed to find effective medicine for her flu . This is because every goods in advertisements seems increasingly perfect for her , but they did not cure her pain . As a result , she has no choice but to buy new medicine . As illustrated above , most advertisements fake people in certain degree of functions for more profits .  What is more , the time of adverisements is dramatically short and companies have to give people impressions about their products in the short time . Therefore , they have no choice but to make products seem much better than original .	KOR
In todays world of cut throat competition , advertising plays a major role in increasing the sale of any product . There is a large variety of products available in the market today . Similar products are manufactured by many companies . Hence customer today has a variety of chooice .  The differences in these similar products may be very minute . The advertising helps in exaggerating this diffeences . Take cars for example . One car manufacturer may exaggerate about the spaciousness in the car by comparing it to a lounge ambience in its advertisement . Another car manufacurer in the same category may emphasize on the outer design of the car comparing it with the aerodynamics of a spaceship . Thus both the manufacturers have a selling point to be amphasized .  But as the saying goes looks can be decieving because all that glitters is not gold . There are so many instances in which the customer is fooled into buying a product because of the galmour created around it through advertising . These instances are coming to life almost everyday . There are many letters in the ` letter to the Editor ' columns of newspapers that highlight this point . Let us consider a simple example of buying an apartment . One of my close friends wanted to buy a new apartment . He collected many brochures and visited many incomplete sites of construction . He decided to finalize on the basis of the brochure comparison . The brochure of the apartment he zeroed on spoke about the spacious rooms , facilities like gym , sauna , play park and many more amenities . After actually shifting to the apartment he was surprised to see big spacious rooms accompanied with lot of plumbing problems , no gym , the sauna without water in the pipes and so on . But if the advertisement hoardings were to be followed , this was a dream apartment . This is a common case for a large variety of products .  Going from the advertising point of view , the advertisers are paid to make the products look good even if they actually arent . Take an example of a popular razor which shows leading sports personalities using it . This razor actually caused skin problems to a customer according to a news paper . But the company that made this ad made profit and successfully helped in selling the product .  There are many more instances which help in supporting the statement that advertisements do make products look much better than they actually are and I completely agree with this notion .	HIN
Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects prevents one 's true learning , and therefore is not a reliable way to study , compared to specializing in one specific subject .  When I was in middle school in Korea , students had much more subjects to learn than in New York , where I live in now . We had to master Physics to Endineering , and had major tests each term . Studying the twelve or more subjects that I was supposed to get as high score as possible , I wondered if that type of study really helped me to learn , and achieve what I needed to survive in society . Many of the subjects , such as engineerng , cooking , or music in my case , were unatractive to me , and most of all , unnecessary for my future . Many other students would have similar preoblem . Also , it is very hard , or impossible , for a person to master such many subjects .  One may argue that in order to well adapted in our society , people need multiple numbers of field which one can do well . For example , in typical companies , employees need to be good at claculating and annalyzing informattion , socializing with other people , which might require various kinds of skills . However , if one tries to maste too many disciplines , it is more likely not to be helpful for one 's career , because still , he/she needs to be professionally good at only one discipline , which the person will be working on through out the career .  The most ultimate reason for studying many disciplines is that it prevets one from truely learning something , no matter what it is . When a person have broad knowledge of many subjects , it means that he/she has no professional knowlegde abut anything . What is the use of knowing so many things , when one knows nothing really useful , valuable , and professional ? Why should one struggle to have so many meaningless knowledge that everyone else can easily learn also ?  There is no meaning nor fun to have broad and common knowledge of many subjects . The fun of learning , and concentrating on one discipline sincerely and truely is at consuming the subject which you love , and which fascinates you .	KOR
I agree with this statement that it is much better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because if you just one way to a solution , sometimes you can not be able to make a solution , so it is very important to have a broad knowledge . For example you are only able to write with your hands and you are not used to write on a pc , you will get in troble in many situations in daylie business live .  An other problem can be , if you are specialized and someody want to dicuss an problem with you which is also imprtant for you to get aware of but you can not say anything because you do not understand what the problem means to others . That is a big problem in our society , because everyone is kind specialized in one 's own life and you often see only your problems whether other 's have much more problemes .  The next problem for specialized people is , that they normally can only do one job in their whole life . I think if you get rid of the job you do , it is much better to have the ability to change it and that will be much easier with an broad knowledge . But if you are specialized in one specific subject it will be very hard to get an other job without losing time by taking courses to ` improve ' one 's knowledge . Not to forget the money you can not earn in this period o time .  As a result I would say that a broad knowledge gives you much more quality of life and a higher varety of jobs .	GER
Nowadays the car is connected to our everyday life so much more than any other way of transporting is . We often use car to go to work or to go to school , we use car in order to be somewhere else in the less time it is possible ; we use car also , and maybe first of all , for going out in the evening , when buses and tubes are maybe full of no raccomanded peoples and somethings like that . ..  On one hand car is for sure our best way of transporting because it is easy to use and it needs not to be in queue for the tikets for example , but I think that the real question is : Is the car really the best solution , the best urban solution to reach a place , to go to somewhere ? Or maybe would the car be one day a real problem in our everyday lives , instead ? I think that the answer is that in a few years the car will be the worst way of transporting because of the increasing number of drivers in the streets , and most of all because of the incoming problem of the pollution !  According to me , in the end , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as a natural consequence of the improving of our own lives . I think also that my opinion is supported by all those experiments that scientists and ingenieers are doing in order to convert our way of moving in a city with alternatives way of transportings and also with alternatives carburants maybe less nocives . For example I think that in the future our cities will support much more transporting by train than by car in order to move much more people at a time , eliminating problems connected with traffic and pollution .

I disagree this idea . First , learning the facts is basical thing . If we enter the class which famous teacher making , we can not understand in real meanings . Learning the facts makes us wake up . We are students . We are cheep person . But we study facts , we can become the perrson who can have real thinkings . Secondly , understanding is discribing the way of thinking . We act on the basical thinkings . Basical thinkings can be affected by other person 's thinkings . Belief is good examples . Person can only think about one way of thinking , he is very danger .  Japanese students do not know real facts . And they tend not want to know the real facts . They know the facts are hard for themselves . They are runing away . Because teacher should teach facts . We should pay attenntion to recieve facts .	JPN
Do successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ? I do n't agree with that . I think experience , time , and the higher possibility of success are the main points to support my opinions .  Firstly , experience helps people to be successful in doing one job . If a person has a lot of experience on doing one job , he can usually make the best decision when a problem comes out . Compare to a person who makes a decision when he does a new job , he is unexperienced and has no idea which way has more benefits for him . So he can easily make a wrong or worse decision . So successful people would do what they already know how to do well because they have experience .  Secondly , we need enough time to make our jobs successful . Working a job to be successful is a long process . A person who does a job which he already knows how to do well , saves a lot of time on understanding basic knowledge of the job . Then he can spend more time to make the job perfect and and make himself to be successful .  Finally , a person does a job which he already knows how to to do well , he has a higher possibility of success than those who try new things and take risks . As we know , if we try a new job , we have no experience about that and have to spend plenty of time to understand the job . It is risky to do that because we might find out we are not able to make it successful after spending a long period time . On the contrary , if we already know a job well , of course we know what to do to make it successful directly efficiently .  I disagree that successful people try new things and take ricks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because they do n't have experience , enough time and a higher possibility of success in doing the new job .

I always thinked about the day the I wiil be old without a particular fear . That 's because I think that the experience gained during an intere lifetime can be useful to go throuhgh the problems more deeply . This broader vision of thinks , given by experience can definitely lead to a good quality of life . As an example I would like to talk about my grandfather : until the age of almost eighty years he enjoyed his life . During his lifetime he had a lot of terrible experiences , infact he went to the second world war and he lost his first son . All those experiences gave to him an additional strenght .  I also think that to be an adolescent can be very hard because , in this sort of twilight , you still do n't know what to do when an important choice have to be done . On the other end , elderly people have gained the necessary experience to make ponderate and rational choices . As another factor that makes me state that you can still enjoy life also if you are old is that , in modern days , there have been many improvements in medical field that , as a consequence , brought to an average better condition of elderly people . All those factors as a broader vision of thinks given by experience , a deep knowdlege of itself and the recents improving in health condition of elderly makes me see my future years in an optimist way and makes me look at future with no fear .

I disagree with that article . It is imagine that there is some subject what i have to solve , i have to explain with several reason of supporting detail . And those reason are help the explaining . For instance , i would like to deal with microwave . First , i should judge about the subject . i should have gradually motion if iwant to use the microwave . So i can think about motion how can i use the microwave . Also , i have to deal with specific step . when i make the solution , i have to explain hte way more easily . For example , first step is what to do , second step is what to do . .. ect Inconclusion , All these reason are appear that the one specialize specific subject are good . So it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects	KOR
There different attitudes toward taking tirp . Some people prefer to act individually and take trip by their own or by a coupl of close friends . On the other hand some people are defenders of tour packeges and rely on tour guides . I personally think , taking trip specially for strange and unknown places needs a grest deal of information about such regions .  First of all , there many unpreditable conditions which at first may seem so interesting whle practically it could turn into an unwanted disaster . For instance consider you want to go to a place which have hered alot about its breathtaking and spectaculatr view . You are tempted to take trip and visit that region . While trekking you feel that you are attached to earth and could not move . Suddenly you know that you are in the marshland . In such situation there is no remedy while you could visit there by a group .  Furhtermere , in a group most of people could take more responsibality and all work are done more organised in comparison with individual actions . By sharing different responsibilty and tasks no person will feel exhuasted and consequantle the journey will be more enjoyable for all . For instace in a climbing one could prepare the food or one could carry the stuff .  Moreover , generally speaking group collaborative actions increse individual 's sense of responibity and consequenty from scial aspect these people could become a good team player and in other soicial action they couldact ecffectively .  To sum up there are many vitues in group travels . Firstly , decreasing the possibility of occuring some dangerous and unpredictable events . In addithin sharing resposiblities among group member wil make travelers relaxed . Finall being in groups stimulates people 's sense of responsibilty for other social actions in future .	TUR
in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subejcts by number of reasons . first , to know about many kind of things be great influences for the future . when you get job , you will not do same kind of work for whole life . my father is priest and keeps a kindergarden . he knoews about children because his major was teaching in his college . after he left grduated the college , he went to another college and studyed about religion . he talks to so many people and has good activities and hobbys . second , you will be able to make good relationships with other people . there are so many people around you and everyone is different and have defferent interests . if you have only limited knowledge and if a conversation is not about the subject you know , the conversation may be boring for each other . finally , if you specialize in one specific subject , you will know about the subject very well . but so many things will be limited such as job , relationships . i think it is not interesting to live .

I disagree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping out their communities . On the contrary , their levels of awareness about the plight of people around the world has increased from yesteryears and a growing number of youngsters are lending a helping hand to the society .  Today people are making a mark for themselves at very early stages of their lives . Young movie stars , musicians , sportspersons and the likes of them are winning the hearts of millions around them . In the process they are making millions . But one can proudly say that a considerable proportion of their funds is directed towards charity . The `` Bill and Melinda Gates ' '' foundation was set up a long time back when Bill Gates was in his prime . The amount of work that has been put in by the then young couple is commendable when it comes to talking about AIDS and cancer relief . Although a middle aged couple now , their work goes on .  If we dont talk about the celebrities and concentrate our attention on the school kids , we find that community service has started coming more naturally to them . There is a sense of pride attached with reaching out to the less previliged . Children consider themselves to be heroes of sorts if they do a good deed and help out people . The fact that schools and colleges have taken a positive step by according due importance to social work while considering admissions is an added impetus . It prompts youngsters to do their bit . Even if done out of personal interest , it exposes one to the joy of `` reaching out '' and prods them to do more .  One can cite numerous examples of engineers and doctors who have graduated from ivy league colleges and can easily make big bucks . But statistics show that an ever increasing number of these graduates are turning their backs to high paying jobs in favor of settling down in small villages and towns . All this because they feel a sense of attachment and duty towards their homeland and truly believe in alleviating the troubles of their nations .  Thus , the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities is unqualified and underrates the contribution of youngsters towards building a better society .	HIN
It is often said that tour guide with many people is the best way to travel because it is cheap and safe . However I strongly disagree with this opinion . This is because that feeling satisfaction through the trip and spending time well .  First of all , people have to be satisfied with their trip . People usaully want to see , hear , eat , and feel what they want and have wanted when they are travelling . However , in a group tour , people can not experience whatever they want because they have to follow their guide . For example , when I went to Paris for trip alone I unwillingly took part in a guide tour one time to go to museam . Because museam entrance fee is cheaper for group . Unfortunately , I did not have satisfaction with the guide tour for museam , because there were so many people , so I could n't see all of them what I want to see and could n't get much information what I expected .  In addition , traveling individaully is better at spending valuable time . Time can not return or use again , so it is very important how to use time . However , in a group tour , it is easy to waste people 's valuable time . To demostrate , according to the research at Harvard , individual trip spend time two times more effectively than grop tour . Moreover according to this studying , people who travel individually is also more satisfied with their time consuming and whole traveling .  In brief , the best way to travel is in a individaul , not in a group because making feel good during trip and well time consuming .	KOR
From past 20 years one of the grooming industry is Automobile industry . It showed its impact on all parts of the world . There is a gradual increase of cars every where . I dont think that number of cars will be reduced after some years . Instead therewill be more number seen than what today . They are palying major role in transportation .  Firstly , cars are ragarded as status symbol for many people . They buy it just to show their status rather using it for some genuine reason . Cars seem to have drastical impact on every class of people staring from lower middle class to upper class . So nowayo a car can be disappeared . .  Seconly they are considered to be more comfortble . car is preferd because it is easy to raech our destination rather waiting for some public transportation . It dont give much stress and makes people get relaxed when compared to other means of transportaion .  Any time it can be used and make our work done in a cool way instaed of rushing for other ways .  Finally , now a days the prices of cars are also declined due to some reasons . so they are affordble by even a middleclass person which again symbolises rise in the cars population .  Being a car owner any person can make a plaln spontaniuosly and even implement it . Like planning for a picnic . And example why anyone go for car is it may be used for all purposes both for official and personal things . And car doesnt realease much of the gas and it is not the victim for pollution too . cars not only serve as personally but they are even used as public transpotation like taxies . So car has its effect on every walk of man 's life to reach the destination and to enjoy luxieries too . I conclude that i cant imagine road without a car as it carry many advantages .	TEL
First of all I would like to make clear that the objectives of marketing and publicity are to highlight the good side of the products they are presenting so the most natural thing is to find that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are but this is something related to a consumer impression not to a advertisement creator issue .  It could be a problem if the advertisement say lies during its presentations or present inexact information that could guide the consumers to a invalid choice . For example if a detergent advertisement presents a cleaning proof , comparing two types of detergentes , it has to present the truth result because there are laws that protect the consumers against abuse and missinformation .  Because of this laws the advertisement world have to be very carefull in the presentation of facts and images and they have developed . Over the years , they have developed many tactics for saying the maximun great things about their products without telling a lie but making the consumers think that their products are the best when sometimes its not the case . For example , talking about beauty spots in the tv , everyday we can see that in the screen supermodels using cremes and beauty products that they say put the skin or hair in an excellent condition but we are fooling ourselves if we think that using that products it will make that we became as beautiful as those supermodels . That is not the fault of the advertisement guys because it is their work try to make their products the most desiderable for us .  Finally , consumers need to be realistic and critic with the actual advertisement world , puting in the balance all the concepts and knowledge they have to determine if a product is as good as it is presented .

People are always tending to pursue the most that they may obtain . When it comes to the aspect of knowledge obtaining , the situation is similar . However , sometimes they have to choose whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject . For myself , I will choose the latter , but will try to get some balance as well .  Nowdays , knowledge is exploding everyday , as a result , it is rather difficult for one to learn broadly and deeply at the same time . Having broad knowledge seems attractive , but actually , it is not practical after the second thought . In the academic circle , there are experts and authorities in almost every field , all of whom hold some specific research interests and accompishment of their own . If one just spend most of the time on learning knowledge of many subjects , he or she may not have the time to do related research . Besides , since it is quite easy to gain information currently , it is not necessary to know all , for if you want , you can look the needed information soon .  However , if one specialize in one specific subject , things will be quite different , especially when he or she choose a valuable but rarely-touched field . Under this situation , he or she will become the expert in this field and it is possible to do some quite profound research on it , which will be more benifitable if one knows about a lot but really knows little on each subject . As long as the researchers are willing to share their results , communicat to each other , and do teamwork when it is necessary , it does not matter whether all these researchers are able to have broad knowledge .  At the same time , to keep some balance , it is also important for a researcher to know some basic knowledge on related subjects , which could broaden the eyesight and inspire him or her fresh ideas . Besides , this will not waste too much time .  To sum up , generally , I think it is better for one to specialize in cetain subject , but it will be good to know some concerning knowledge at the same time , which can make the work most effectively .

I agree with the statement . It is more important to understand the ideas and concepts . Learning the facts without understanding the bottom line of it does n't make sense . It does n't help people to improve themselves and derive the point from the facts . For example learnin about science , if we do n't know the basic idea behind the fact we never get the connection between the releated facts .  Besides if we dont teach our students the concepts behind the facts we would just developed a banch of encylopedias for future not an efficient and smart generation . They have to know reasons , factors , consequences and developments about the facts . Only knowing the fact does n't stand for much . There is some before the fact and there is some after the fact . If they know both part , it makes sense and draw a picture in their mind . It will fly and never stable in mind without it .  Also it is really necessary for students to know concepts behind the facts to make it easier them to understand easily . Think about it . When they are learning gravity , if you dont explain the factors , reasons and just tell them the ground pulling us through what they would understand . Probably nothing .  In conclusion , humans always look for reasons , results and factors . They want to know why ? So for students it s important to know ideas and concepts .	TUR
I do agree with following statement . I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . All the subjects are important in my life and I 'm sure there can help my future plan , like to pass the test for university , to find the goodest job . I have two more reasons for it .  First , I think it is nice way to study many academic subjects . I will write my experience as a example . Now I am studying many subjects in the high school , and I like studying all of them . It is very fun to study many subjects and increase my knowledge . The English class express my speaking , History class express listening , and I am enjoying communicate with my friend during other classes . All the subjects have different advantage . Therefore I want to study all the subject and I think it is boring to do only one subject .  Second , it is not vain to have knowledge of many academic subjects . We can use our knowledge everywhere . When we take the test for university , and when we find the job after graduating . All of the subjects are useful . Recently , some people are thinkking that it is not important for childern to study extra subject like physical education , music , and art . However , it is all important , we can know how fun it is and enjoy doing these . I think it is important to enjoy the subject , not just study demanded subjects like English , Math , Science . The extra subjects also express our knowledge and it will be useful in our communication .  For these reasons which I mentioned above , I support the passage that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . It will expand our thought and it will surely useful in our life . To study many subjects is very fun .	JPN
In my opinion , I agree this statement . I think that number of cars will dicrease at least around in next decades . There are a few reasons for it . First , recently concern for environmental pollutions is getting higher . Of couse , it does not cause of only cars , but the great number of cars apparently affect to air and water and so on . Moreover , in our daily life car is very notivable ellement to environment .  Second , from aforesaid first reason , the number of prietors is not increasing like before . For example , my parents thought it as a dream to buy car when they are young . Now , I am almost same age to them at that time , but I do not need any cars . I do not feel necessary to it . The meaning having car is changinng more than before .  Third , many vehicle have developed very well , so we can go anywhere by using them , such as train or airplane or ship . Moreover , although there is not only one company but also a lot of company offer their vehicles with competing , we can use them cheaper than before .  Some people may disagree with my this opinion . The market of motor cars is still now storong , therefore it never decrease theis number . Of couse , in Japan also , the market is still now vegorous . If I watched TV program , I can see a lot of commercials through the time . Even now a lot of people may be purchasing their new cars . But I think that recent main stream has changed ovbiously , that is to say , recently the most moticable stream is new type of car that never excharge any pollutant . In addition , eco-car is famous and popular , which use not nonrenewable resouces , petrileum , but electricity . I think that this show our view had changed from before .  Therefore , I agree this statement that recently fewer cars are in use . The number of car will change into fewer .	JPN
Facts can be research by student in order to improve their knoledge about an idea . There is several ways to support the statement that is more important understan ideas and concepts than acquire knoledge of facts . Science requiere student to think constantly and develope a critic way to think . For example , for a lawyer it is more importante to learn how to think logically than learn a set of laws in order to be sucesfull in his carrier . A set of laws can change withing one period of Congress ; this will leave the given lawyer who just learn a set of laws obsolet . He will need to go to university to learn again the set of laws to be usefull in his field . Fortunately , this is not the way that lawyer learn about their carrier , most of the knoledge adquired at a law school is to think logically . Even with a cange of legislation a lawyer still been a lawyer . However , there is allways the requirement to be updated with tecnology and new researchs to be succesffull in any given carrier . For a historian there is no discution that is require to learn facts . The same concep does not apply for a doctor .  There is allways the necesity of improve proceces to evolve with socity . This is the reason that universities develop research departments . If socity does not make research there will be no progress in many industries . In order to achive progress stdents make research to understand ideas and concepts . If their noledge is based just on facts they would be no able to discover new theories . For example , all the improvement in telecomunications . Thanks to the understanding of ideas and concepts student has improve the internet telephony making ship to call long distance .  Finally , will be imposible to socity to progress if we just waste time to learning facts . Like in a picture , socity will be static with no improvement , like the Menonites that like to live in the past ignoring the new opportunities that ideas brings .	SPA
I agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .  First , student must learn what it is meaning . They totally understand the definitions , concepts and the ideas . For example , if a student does not know the definition , he or she could not prove the theorem . He or she could not combine the two different problems to solve . If it is not known what the plus mean , it can not be said one plus one equals two .  Second , knowing the reason or reasons , shows the paths that goes the facts . Students always seek the reasons beyond what they see . Only the learning the results does n't enough . They have to ask where is this coming from ?  I think , to do something important we expand our vision and dig deeper than ever . We would expose undiscovered things only when we do n't limited ourselves with the given facts .	TUR
I 'm not so sure that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact . I think that this statement is quite generic and incomplete . if it is referred to historical studies , it could be accettable . for example , it is more important for a student tho understand why the world wars had occurred than the specific facts and dates linked to war 's history . and this example could extended to the general comprenshion of the actual world 's politic situation . But without knowing facts it 's difficult to make a personal idea on an argoument .  if we take for example scientific fields we have to refuse this statement , it 's impossible to discuss about a scientific idea without knowing the specific facts ( rules , laws , properties ) connected to this idea .  so , my personal opinion is that there is n't a division between facts and concept , they are strongly connected . ( here we could open a philosophical discussion about facts and judments in kant 's theory ) i suggests to the other students to make sure to know very well a fact before giving an opinion , and to investigate a fact before accepting other 's opinion . this problem involved the eternal problem of the historical founts : scholars have to believe in historical narrations whithout the real possibility to control themselves the truely of a fact on the contrary , the figure of the critic should be an example of a person who can see and study a fact and than give his opinion about that fact .  so , in order to give a correct and credible opinion about something , is very very important to study the facts themselves .

I agree that Young Peoples enjoy life more than older peoples do . My first point which is most important is that , they are young . Since they are young they have lots of energy to enjoy by the ways they want . For example , if someone think he enjoy his life by playing some outdoor games , when he has a plenty of time . Now , if thinker is young person he can just grabb his stuff to play & go on . But suppose this comes in a mind of an old person thats not possible easilly because he has to remind quick what kind of restrictions his doctor make on him . Also other point is lack of energy . He may not be able to perform that task even if he will enjoy in out door games . He has to compromise with things like just watching T.V or having family dinner parties , an easy way of enjoyment all older peoples prefer .  Also second thing which support my agreement is , travelling or trip which lots of peoples like & good way of enjoyment . When all the friends come together & make a plan for a long trip , is easy for youngsters because they are able to face all the kinds of problems starting from weather changes to walking a miles away by foot when there car is out of fuel . But in case of older peoples they need support in such kind of situations . They can not face as youngsters can . They need there medicines ready while weather changes happens & even though they are preprepaired , they are not sure that there body can respond well .  So , basically young peoples can enjoy there life more than older peoples as they have enough enery to enjoy by the way they want . But older peoples also have so many ways to enjoy there rest of life . As , at one time when they were young they also had fun .	HIN
I totally agree with the statement given above .  First of all , advertisements only show the advantages of a product and not the possible disadvantages . I made this experience for my own for quite a several times . I remember the first advertisements of the IPod from Apple . The customers really got the feeling , that the IPod was not only a simple music player in a good looking design , but even that it is the most handiest player on the market . I was one of the first people who bought an IPod but after a short period of time I was a little bit depressed about my decision . The advertisements did not show , that for example it was only possible to change the recorded music with one single software program and only one computer at once . I have still got the IPod , but in fututre I will be better informed about the features of a product , before I buy it .  Furthermore , quite a lot of products do not aim the characteristics in the way the advertisements show . A good friend of mine is working in the marketing business unit of a company , which is doing the advertising for different companies . It is allways very intersting and funny when we are getting together for a drink and talk about our jobs . Everytime it is the same that he tells me about new of his customers and their products . My friend and his collegues sometimes do not even see one advantage of a product which should be advertized by them , but it is their job to present the product in a kind of way that people have the desire to buy it .  As I have shown above , advertisements do not allways shows the truth about a product and put much better light on it than it is . I made these experiences for several times and I learned from this . I think everybody should be aware of , that the product she/he buys is perhaps not as perfect as the advertisment of the product showed .	GER
From the newest article , I heard about the successful person who tried new things and took risks . It talks to me about the one of good ways to succeed in our major is using our imagination for new things and trying risks . Also , I agree this opinion , and want to talk about more detail .  First , I want to talk about new things . When I was grown up , I heard many successful people 's stories such as Adison and Nobel . Those people are accomplish their dream to using their imagination to try new things . In addition , it is based on our civilization 's development because people always want to have good , interesting and convenient things , so from the invention of new things , they will buy those and satisfy . In other words , invention of new things can get more money , and sometimes we can get a fame . As a result , it a good ways to be a successful people .  The second reason is based on the taking risks . Risks are dangerous in our lives . For example , if we fail to make some good new things , we will lost all of things such as house , family and the other things . However , if we prepare it before risks are started , we can reduce . In addition , there are no risks about new things , we can not create new things because always new things are related some risks which is dangerous in our lives . Although , sometimes we can figure out risks for our successful , we try to make new things . Moreover , we have to take care of ourself , and always we have to prepare some bad situations . For preparing the bad situation , we can reduce on the damage , when some risks are happened .  In our lives , we always demand new things than before . Even if it can take risks to the person who try new things , it is a short way to be a successful person . Sometimes , from overcome the bad situation , we can be important people . For these reason , I would like to say that trying new things and taking risks help us to be a successful person . Moreover , those behaviors make us positive and considerable people .	KOR
Today , many advertisements are making much products . And they are making profits more than what they suppose to have . And there is couple reason for it .  First reason is , most advertisements has some kinds of bubble . The bubble what am I talking about is , the bubble which make advertisements look more fency and more valuable . For example , they are entertaining themselves so they can show their appearance to people so they can make people think those advertisements are really good and support those advertisements . Another example is , they are using the commer show . Many people are spending time for watch the commer shows when they are watcing the television . And most advertisements are using commer show and entertaintment . So , most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are .  Second , they are helping each other and make more profits by information or some of helping . And they are entertaining each other to the other people who do not know about those advertisements really much . So they got more people and they get more profit and products more than what they suppose to have .  Many advertisements are making products much better than what they suppose to make . However , I think it is one of the skill for them . And advertisements are one of member for cycle of economy . So , I think those are not that bad except some of the other things that so many bubbles .	KOR
The students ' teaching method is very controversive between the approach focused on the facts and the other more based on the concepts and the ideas . I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for three main reasons : understanding ideas can help the student to understant facts , it is easier to learn facts individually , understanding ideas allow the student to develop its own reflexion and criticism .  Firstly it seems to me than when a student understands ideas and concepts than will help it to understand the facts . Indeed it would be not very interesting for a student to learn a succesion of facts without knowing why these facts are happening . For example the history facts are numerous and it is impossible to keep all of them but if you understand the ideas of an special historical event you can learn better all the facts that are associated with this event .  Secondly I think that it is easier to learn the facts individually than understand ideas and concepts . As a matter of fact , the professor can give to their students keys that will help them to understand the idea . At the contrary the facts are not difficult to understand and also the support of the professor is not indispensable . The professor can illustrate the facts with personal experiences and therefore making them more interesting but he will not change the facts .  Finally , I believe that the understanding of ideas and concepts for a student is the basis of the development of its own reflexions and also to have criticism . By identifying the structure of a conceptor a idea , the student can develop its own ideas and build also a thinking system . For instance a student that understand well a special philosophy concept can do its own theory about the concept .  To conclude I can say that the understanding of ideas and concepts is the most important part of a student learning process , even if it is not unnecessary to learn facts but not as the first priority .

Advertising was created in order to make people buy things . Nowadays , competition is very significant between brands and each brand has to struggle in order to convince people to buy their products . Marketing departments deal with that .  As for me , I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Because of globalisation , we can nowadays find almost whatever we want in each country and more particularly in developped countries . Which implies that competition is very rude since there are so many products available for customers . The choice is huge and how can we decide which product to buy when we do not know them ?  As a consequence , brands launch many advertising campaigns . They do their best in order to do the best campaign . Thanks to advertising techniques , they enhance their products as much as they can . Because they need to have the product that would the most catch people 's attention  Usually , when someone look at a billboard or watch a commercial on TV about a new food product , it is so well promoted that we are most of the time very interested by the product and we are very excited to go and test it . But we are unfortunately often disappointed . Indeed , if I take the example of a new burger launched by McDonald , the burger will seem very very good in picture . However , when I will go and try it , the bread will be too dry , the cheese will not have the same aspects . .. And once again , I will wonder why things are almost never the same as in the advertising .  Advertising agencies usually deal with significant budgets and they use amazing techniques sometimes to enhance the product .  Not only , the aspects are not the same , but also the features are not what they tend to be . Actually , some products ensure to do this or this and when you try them , the result is not the one you were expecting .  Finally , I would like to add that this does not only occur for products but it also happen for famous people . Most of the stars you see in magazine are gorgeous but in the real life they are not the same , you can be very surprised . All this is due to the marketing that makes everything or evyone being perfect .	FRE
it is a difficult question because i think that every aspectof study is important for students . i am not agree in total with the statment that says that is better for students to undestand ideas and concepts than to learn fact , because i think they have the same importans in a development of young people .  in general i think that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts because it is only with this passage that they can have theirs opinions and ideas , but at the same time it is also important to learn facts because with the knoledge of process of the facts people can do what it was be right in the past and do not what was dangerous or wrong .  for example i thaink that the concept of peace can be better undersand if you know history , in fact with that matter you understand that war gives people only poverty , difficulties and not good things . i think that it is easy to understand concepts if you have a real invironment in some facts .  the ideas and concepts , with the study and learning of facts give us a strong base of our education and it is important for a good future improuvment . finally i think that both of this aspects are important for a good development of young people , so students have to undestand ideas and concepts	ITA
I agree that it is better to have broad knowlenge or many academic subject because this give you that experienres to talk with deferent types of people also can be help you in looking for a good job .  One of the good thing about having a good broad knowlenge is that you have the change to talk with different types of people . Knowing or having expirence or be specialize different topic gives you the possibility of talk and dicusts with different people of different knowlenge and ideas . A good example can be you are in one convesion about Organic Chemestry adn you know about this topic you can ask question or get in to the big diccution with the other specialist on the case . This will give a good impresion to the other poeple and make more friend or nowing more .  Another that is good to have a broad knowledge is that you can get a very good and well pay job . Today in our society big institucion and companies are looking for people who are very smart or have good undertending of something . If you can have good understanding and know what that things that good company ask you to do you can have a very good fundametal job . For example , today is really exencial to use a computer . Well , if you now who to work the computer and who to work many programs in the computer you can have a good pay job and secury .  Today is really good to know about different topic or different issues because this new society is changing really quit . To have broad knolenge in htis new sociaty can help a lot to survive or even to have got undertanting in what all this new vocabulary is about becaue many people who study only what thing can sometime they do not nothing about other topic .

Advertisements often tease the pospective customer with the newest , most advanced and simply coolest goods or services . To be unique in a diverse market environment it is literally inevitable to cheat the buyer .  Advertisements have to have a short and stong message . Due to this briefness it is impossible to present the product in an appropriate and honest way . Consumers who bought a product which was advertised as reliable or easy to use often are unsatisfied with what they finally hold in their hands . But who is to blame ? Of course the companies are presenting the products in the best possible way , that 's what I would do too . On the other hand we , the customers , do n't want to hear lenghty advertisements in which products are explained in detail .  The phenomenon of wrongly advertised products is not a new one . In my opinion people should be clever enough to know that companies say whatever it takes to sell a product .  For example when a cellphone is advertised the commercial could say : The best cellphone ever built . This statement , of course , can not be prooved by anyone . Therefore we have an exageration and probably even a false statement .  Another example is food and drinks . How can a commercial seriously say : The most delicious burger ever . A customer who buys and tries it ultimately has the expectation of a great burger . But what if he does n't like it . This means the advertisement industry is neither able to shape our taste nor to advertise products in a proper way .  So far I have been describing the black sheeps among the advertising companies . Nonetheless there are companies who present their products honestly without exaggerations or even lies . Especially when comparisons are made the customer can be sure to watch a good advertising .  In the end it 's all up the the prospective custome whether a commercial is believed or not .	GER
I agree with this statement which is that , `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . '' I feel this way because if we go for the products by just looking at the advertisements then we can not really judge a product just by sitting at home and looking at an advertisement .  First reason that think that advertisements do n't at all make products better than what they are , is that , what we see can not be true or a right thing most of the times . For example an adverisement on tv showing about a new car launched by some xyz company . Well to buy a car we really need to go out to a showroom and have a look at it as well as test drive it . But just by looking at an ad we ca n't predict the way in which a car would be handling at severe turns and bends . Well  Secondly nowadays a lot of advertisemnt endorsing is done by popular faces like the actors sportsmen and so on . Well i saw an advertisement of a bike recently on tv . This bike was endorsed by rising sportstar . In my hometown a lot of people by seeing this advertisement went to the showroom and bought that bike . Well i certainly know from the response from which iam hearing about the bike from my fellow friends is that the bike was n't even worth a penny .  It was so poorly designed . The electronics the engine was the major problem concerning that bike . Now my friends are complaining to the dealer about their sorry state . So i do feel that by just following an advertisement one should not loose his normal senses and end up buying false products .  Additionally people who are making these advertisements about the products as well as those endorsing these products do they really use these products ? Well it seems to be an interesting question . For example an actor in my hometown is endorsing a product of personal computer and laptops . But recently at a film production unit my friends did see him using a laptop of another brand . This means that he is sure that the product which he is endorsing is unreliable . Mostly we would not find all of the above people who make these advertisements , using these products . They would be using products from more famous brands and reputed ones . Hence we should not always look at an advertisement an buy the product .  In conlusion to the above mentioned points i firmly believe that todays advertisements are no more than a fake piece of information that is shown on television to make money out of the innocent people . Thus i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	HIN
I disagree , because population are increasing day by day in the world . It is connected with cars also . Car companys pruducting a new car every year . When I analyse the traffic every cars has one people transporting . Every family has two cars minimum . Because cars price also decreasing and peoples earns money moch more before . Government must solve this problem but nobody dont do anything . Government investigate to Underground and bus systems .  For example Istanbul is a huge city . There are 15 million people live in istanbul . Also there are 5 million car in our city . But Istanbul has not a underground metro network . Also bus is very old to transportation . Also Taxi is not chipher . Because of all of this points peoples choose to buy a car and use it daily woks . I think this is a general problem all of the world .  The another point that is old cars in the traffic . There are lots of old cars in the traffic that is more than 20 years old . These cars try to work successfully and try to transport peoples . In this case it is need to establish new laws for traffic on the counties . For using a car , It must be prohibit for more than 20 years old cars I think .  Also the scientist reserch that for trying to work a car with electricity ennergy or walther . If it will be possible , I think car population also grow up . In the world oil price very high right now . But electricity or wather is so free /	TUR
Although some people think the idea that it is important for students to learn facts , I think understanding ideas and concepts is important for students . There are two reasons for this : the ability of concentration , maintaining the memory .  To begin with , to learn the facts is easy . I think only listening to the lecture can say people are learning . This is all people can do . However , understanding ideas and concepts is not easy . For example , when I understand the idea of some theory , I should study very hard . Therefore , understanding is equal to study very hard . It is improve the ones ability of concentration .  In addition , the thing that people spend much time to understand is not easy to forget . For instance , the theory that I only listen to at the science class is forgotten soon . However , I study by readng the book about the theory very hard after class , and then I do not forgat for a long time .  For these reasons , I agree the statement that it is i	JPN
I agree , it is the best way to travell in a groups led by a tour guide because in groups the tour may be fulfilled with full of fun and joy .  One can always feel boring to travell as accompained . the tour in groups all together can fell like one family as brothers , sisters , uncles grandfathers and grandmothers . So there we feel very happy by spending with all the group people and there is no worries as there is a guide who helps and shows all the locations all the way .  In groups there is no need of a security problem no feeling of lonelyness . In groups we may have many concessions in the fairs and some packages which were offered at low rates this was an advantage for travelling in groups .  The best example when i 'm in high school we had a tour to NewDelhi in meanwhile we enjoyed all the way in the train by singing songs , dancing and commenting one another . After reaching there we in group visited all the tourist spots and spent very jolly .  It was the time when I visited the same locations alone and i felt very bad , even not intrested to see all the places . Another reason is the people with whom do we like to have the tour may is always busy or unable to have time to come with us . So we never feel missing them when we move in groups . We dont know the time spent with them it is like a magic me may forget all the things and move to the new world of dreams .  Everyone likes to visit all the places , bu mostly they think about the travelling time and the expences . If we travell in single the expences will be more we should spent moreon the comodities for our needs . In the groups travellin expences for person to person may vary as the number of persons is incresaing cost for head to head may vary . So within the low budget , with security , with company we may have our tour sucessfully with lot of joy and happiness .	TEL
In spite of the benefits of learning facts , I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts . There are three main reasons why I have this opinion .  In the first hand , I support the idea that understand ideas and concepts in a field ( for instance economy ) gives a overall comprehension of this field and the process that can occur in that field . Thus , it allows graduate students that come into the labor market to meet the requirements of numerous jobs even if they did not study certain characteristics of some tasks .  Then , I have the belief that when a student has well understood ideas and concepts in a field , he is then able not only to understand the new events that can take place in this area , but also to learn itself from this fact .  Finally , from my perspective , the facts are widely dependant from the time and the conditions in which they occur . Consequently , an event that took place in a certain situation or a certain country , for example a major workers strike in France before a change in political majority , can not be interpreted than one in Bangladesh during a very harsch time . Futhermore , facts may be linked to a fashion in the way of thinking or the way of product goods . An illustration of this idea could be the the fact that an American citizen sold a lot of French foie gras because he likes that at a certain period , but still not do that because of a change in both the relationship between the American government and the French one , and the way to consider the treatment of the ducks .  However , I admit that learning facts may help a understand concepts either not concrete at all or a little difficult . As a conclusion , I think that it is both more important and useful for the future life for students to understand ideas and concepts . Nevertheless , learning facts can sometimes be necessary .	FRE
It is a challenging question that whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . First of all , I want to mention that both of them are good but it is impossible to be the best in many academic subjects . In my opinion , unlike having a broad knowledge of many subjects , being the best in one specific subject is much more valuable .  I think that the specialization in one specific area can give person much more advantages when we compare it to the broaden knowledge . For example , if you have only broaden knowledge about many subjects , this tells people that you are not a qualified person . It only makes you more intellectual but spacialization is required in order to have a good job opportunity . Today being intellectual does not enough in order to live well . Unless you have any specialization , you can not earn good amount of money .  Moreover , being specialized can be seen as the reflection of the success . You can be the most successful person in your specialized area with researching and working more and more . For instance , you can be a well known scientist or professor in your field . This is impossible for the person who has a broaden knowledge in many areas because life is short and you do not have lots of time to learn the everything about every subject . Instead of this you should use your time in one area which can make you the best .  In order to summarize , as I mention in my essay , I am disagree with the idea that it is better to heve broad knowledge of many subjects . According to me , being the best in one area is much better than having a broaden knowledge . Specialization is not only the chance of the good position but also the reflection of the success .	TUR
In my opinion in some cases it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , instead , in another cases , it 's better to specialize in only one or two specific subjects .  I think that at the primary , secondary and high school it 's better to have a generical knowledge , like what is actually in use in the majour states of the world ( I belive and I hope it is truth ) , than to specialize in only one specific subject . Here we have a thirteen generical years knowledge and I think it is not bad !  I think that when we arrive at university it is right to specialize in only one or two specific subjects because actually we live in a world where everyone think to be able to do everythihg but this is not the truth !  I think it 's important to be a very good professionist in one thing to be different from the mass .

This is a tipical statement that shows a view of the world in which young people refuse responsabilities and problems having fun in their community while older people , growing up , lose this sense of fresh and spontaneous life .  This statement is known in our society probably because we are used to see young people studing , not working , and taking part to many activities , something as sports or community initiatives . So for us become old means adapting to the rules that civil society , good manners and behaviour require . This passage has always been seen as the increasing awareness of what surrounds us , with all the problems and responsabilities . Probably for that reason old people are considered more serious , understanding , but also sed compered to the brave and spontaneus behaviour of young people .  Anyway my personal opinion is that times are changed and today our world offeres a lots of opportunuties and means to old people in order to mantain reactive body and mind . there are many cases of no more young people that are considered example of our society and I think that this shows the change now expained . I know many people older that me that enjoy and love life as me , because they love their work or they have started some interestig activities that enable them to be active and positive .  In conclusion I can resume my essay saying that in the past probably I would agree with the statement , but today both young and old people know how to enjoy their lives , even if the	ITA
In general , young generations enjoy their life more than older generations do . This is because young people have knowledge or skills to adopt now . Older people are difficult to do that . But , the older people had the time to adjust world , and they must have enjoyed at that time . So , I agree that young people enjoy life than older people do .  In fact , I am in yong generation right now . I , of course , enjoy my life . Going to school , exrcising body and exploring new world are all enjoyable for me and other young people . For doing them , pioneer spirits , health bodies and motivation for getting new things are required . However , it is heavy tasks for olders . Among them , some people are still have those powers , but most people tend to be less motivated . For example , my grandmother does not want to do anything except for her rutines which are to take care of household or talking to only similar people in days . One time , I asked her to travel with my family . But , she refused even if she was very healthy . She just did not want to leave her house and nomal enviroment she spent with .  On the other hands , we young people do not be afraid of new life or enviroment because we have a lot of dreams for new world . It makes us more enjoyable than the olders . I think that the olders ought to have interests to enjoy their life . It might help them to suit society and public . If they do not do that , only thing they have is that they spend rest of their life unhappy or boring . To avoid this situation , they should try to have interests .	JPN
Some people believe that it is better for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . They think that students get benefits by studying others ideas and concepts and use it as a derictory in thier lives and thier educational jaurny , they may use as an example for that the old concept about the shape of the earth and how it had been hold until it was aproved .  I totally disagree with this concept for many reasos , first of all this concepts and ideas might be wrong so it is rediculous to make student hold them . In contrast , we can let them develop thier won under our opservation . Also , some of these concepts are harmful , for example , it is untill recently in my cultural background , poeple inheret and believe the stories about how sertain tribe members are able to come back after thier death . The third reason opposing this concept is that students are the futre . At the time they will be in charge , they need thier won ideas and concepts to deal with it because the every new day the world change .  In conclosion , I disagree with the statement because of variation of the relibilty of the ideas and conceps content , the posibility of it is harm , and to allow them develop their own .	ARA
Young people nowadays have much more things want to do than before . They have to learn more things to fullfill the demands of their lifes . Besides , young people have much more social activities like going the movie , travelling and some things like these . On the other hand , most young people do not have their life goal . They do not know what is really important in their whole life and just spend their time on TV or PC games . All they do is to spend their valuable time on somthing unvaluable and it is a pity for them .  Actually , we can find young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their comminities . Due to the modernlization , the parents bring their children with them to cities to find the jobs . When them go working , their children just leave at home or sent to the baby-garden . Those babies ca n't find their model who give enough time to helping their communities and all their know is to enjoy their life and have fun . There are on doubts about parents always the models for their children . That is the reason why young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . Besides , the public media always deliveries error massages to young people . All the media are talking about having fun . It is also another reason for this problem .  In conclusion , young people will need more education and training to teach them to give enough time to helping their communities and the parents also should be trained to be a model . The public media also need to make some good programs to taught the young about their social responsibilities . According to these activities , we can eventually find young people nowadays give much time to helping their communities . And we will have a better world than before .	CHI
The issue at hand is that is it better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects than to specialise on one subject . This is important becauseit makes us know what students are actually interested in . Ipefer it is better to specialise in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics .  First reason to support my statement is that when we concentrate on many academic subjects we could not concentrate well on all of the subjects . And we can not do well in all the subjects . when you take one specific subject and specialise on it you could concentrate well on the subject and can do justification to the subject . for this reason I think my choice is superior .  Secondly , by specialising on a specific subject makes you learn many new things without any difficulty . and you can focus more on a single point in a better way . By researching on the subject you can discover many new things in that subject . for example many great prople such as einstein devoted his entire life to a specific subject in which he is interested and many discoveries in that field such as mass energy equivalance theorem e.t.c therefore from this reason I support my choice is best .  Finally , all the people would not be interested or capable of learning all the academic subjects . for example if somene is forced by something to learn a subject in which he donot have interest he can not learn it in a proper way . so it is better to specialise in one subject in which he has interest instead of learning all the subjects .  So according to the above reasons mentioned it is better for a student to specialise in one subject in which he is interested rather than learning all academic subjects .	TEL
I agree with this statement because it is a fact and even I am a youngster who is enjoying life . But if we consider the positions of the old they might not have much strength in their body and even in their mind to enjoy their life by visiting other places , friends , relatives and many entertainment places to spend their life .  An youngster can enjoy his/her life by with his/her friends , going out , going to schools , colleges , jobs but the old may not get this oppurtunity . Old people may not have patience , interest in particular things so many old people prefer spending their life in their home or in their guest houses playing with their grandchildren . Though going to schools , colleges might not be interesting to few youngsters but in my point of view it is still an interesting part of our life which if we miss we can not get it back ever .  Studying new things is very interesting rather than sitting at home chatting with the neighbour and watching TV . And I guess most old people spend their time in chatting with anothewr old person and even watching TV . Old people might not enjoy the new technologies and new inventions which an youth might be enjoying . I guess that even old people in those days might not have good education than this generation and might have missed many facts and details which ths generation knows about it .  I hope that the advantages I have listed above are also a part of enjoyment in eveyone 's life . I hope that youth in today generation are in a better working conditions than the people at the past . Even that is too a enjoyment which the old people miss out becuse people in those days must have worked hard and toiled a lot but now we have machines for everything which makes our job lot more easier . Thus I conclude that young people enjoy lifr more than older people do .	TEL
yeah i totally agree with this statement because what is allowing the car to turn on is the gas and the gas is getting more and more expensive because of the decrease of the worldwide gas ressources due to overexploitation .  everybody know thinking about how we are going to substitute gas , some solutions are there but they are to expensive butwhen we will find an appropriate and non polluant fuel it will come out with new automotives it will be a revolution .  nowadays cars rejects too much carbon into the atmosphere and it s very bad for our planet , cars pollute too much and we can t keep on pollutinglike nothing will happen , people will realise how bad is they cars for the atmosphere end everybody will prefer to have a bike or a non polluant automotive vehicle .  the technology allows us to build these kind of cars but the reason why the cars builders ain t generalizing this kind of cars is because now the governements and people don t really see how fast carbon damage our planet but if we keep on polluting wiyth our cars like ther s no consequences in something like 10 years the effects will be more violent and will happen more frequently and that will make everybody want to stop polluting before it s too late .  cars are being banned everywhere in the world . .. for example in paris the mayor closed many of the city roads to the cars and opened it to the buses in oder to force people to take public transportation and let them cars home , in mexico city it s worst because there you can use your car only once in the week , the government did that to decrease air pollutiobn because mexico is one of the most polluted city in the whole world .  cars are too much polluting and it s going to get more and more expensive just to put gas in it so in the next years i m sure you will see new kinds of automotive	FRE
The statement contents that in twenty years the number of cars in use will decline . I do not agree with the claim . According to me , the number of cars will continue to increase thouh there might be a change in the technology which they use .  As the population continues to grow , so are the needs . And , car is emerging as a basic need of the world today . Technological advances have made the dream of a common man , to own a personal car , true . The rates of the car have never been so low , and this sharp decline of prices will continue as the technology progresses . This would further encourage their sale in the near future , as more and more people will be able to afford one .  In earlier times , cars were meant only for the main member of the family , the earning heads . While today , even children and other family members use cars for their personal needs .  Moreover , nowadays , the two-seater sedans are in vogue . This means that if a family of four members use a single car today , they may go on to use two 2-seaters in future .  Futhermore , the other modes of conveyance like the buses or the three wheelers generally cause more pollution than that generated by the cars . Nowadays , cars have been manufactured which use electricity or solar energy to run . The availibility of such cars at affordable prices will help , to some extent , check the , so called , never-ending pollution problem , and hence will be supported by the government of any nation .  However , the increase in the number of cars will accelerate the problem of traffic .  Thus , I strongly feel that in future , the number of cars being used will continue to rise and so will the problem of traffic , but with a decline in the pollution .	HIN
Cars are of vital importance for everyone 's life . Today , we can not imagine a situation without cars . Even if we do not have one ourselves , other people utilize them to make our lives easier - be it a transporter bringing food to the supermarket or the car that brings us to the hospital in case of a severe accident .  In my opinion , we need cars and the populatoin in our country knows that . This is the reason why I think that the number of cars will not diminish in the next 20 years .  There are a myriad of arguments for and against the use of cars : The major argument against cars is certainly the pollution of our environment . And it is true - cars , as we know them today , need certain natural resources and do pollute our environment to a certain degree . If this is always true , there will probably be fewer cars in use in 20 years that there are today . At some point in time , people would recognize the harm of cars and would definitely try to reduce the number of cars to protect the environment .  But this may not be a realistic case : I am of the opinion , that our scientists get smarter and smarter . Until today , they already invented hybrid engines and engines that are only run by solar energy or plant oils . Today , those inventions can not replace cars that need gaz to produce power , because scientists are still trying to get more out of the new foundings . But consider the time the gaz engine needed to be as perfect as we know today : It took long years for the car industry to be able to produce those engines .  Given this evolution , it is possible and very realistic that our scientists will make a huge contribution to the improvement of the ` new ' engines in the next 20 years . Even if 20 years might be too short to develop a car that does not pollute the environment at all , I think that the scientists are on a good way to find an engine that drastically reduces the pollution . And after another 20 years , we might already use cars that do not need any natural resources like gaz . If this is the case , everyone will recognize the outstanding advantages of cars , so that the number of cars will rather increase .	GER
Some people believe that succesful people take risks and try new things in order to acomplish their goals , others believe that doing what they know to do well will get them where they want to be . I believe believe that successful people always have to take risks and not just do what they know to do well .  I will explain why I agree with the statement using an example on an specifical career like engineering . Risks can take you to fields of your carrer that you did not even know exists , because you are always too busy doing what you already know . For example the devlopment of a new technology or the expansion of one that already exist . If you don ; ` t take the risk to explore new things , this new technology might never be developed because you as an engineer are doing the same thing over and over again .  Another advantage ot taking risks is that if you fail you can always go back to what you where doing before . Let 's think of a new product we want to develop . If the engineers have an specifical product for example deodrants in roll-on plastic containers , and they never try to invent another way to apply the product , they probably would not be able to create the spray applicattions . But let 's say they formulate this new application using aerosols and they find out that it is affecting the ozone layer on the planet because of the gases expelled . They can always go back to the roll-on aplication and help the environment . They took the risk with the new technology but it brought a lot of problems so they can go back to the old way to apply the product and solve the problem .  These main two reasons explained why people have to take risks in their professional environment . However this apply to other things in your life . Like for example , in a personal field let 's talk about marriage . When you get married you are taking a lot of risk . You are signing a contract that last forever , not knowing what is going to happen in your life . But as I mentoined , this contract can be voided and if things are rough you can get divorced and go back to your single life . You took the risk looking for success but it did not work so you can go back and star all over again .	SPA
While there may be some people who disagree , I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The reasons why I take this position are elaborated on in the next paragraphs .  Firstly , for example , when I was looking for a used car about 6 years ago , what I did first was to read thoroughly the car magazines . These were full of advertisements actually . There were so much car information in the magazine that I was next to impossible to sellect 3 or 4 candidates . One day , after I managed to do so , went to the car dealer in person to see on of the cars itself . At the sight of the car itself , I was a little confused because the car did n't look as good as in the magazine .  Secondly , when I made uniforms for the baseball team in my company , I again checked the catalogue in depth . In the catalogue , almost every uniform desigh looked cool , but when we ordered one type in the catalogue and finally saw the real uniforms , Iwe were a little dissapointed to see the difference between ones in the catalogue and the real ones .  Furthermore , I have made a company recruiting website for college/university students . This was like a advertisement of our company , our workplaces . We tried hard so that our company would seem excellent . Of course , we did n't made false statements or images using pictures and CGs . But what we tried to do was to collect best pictures of our company and workplaces . So , in this sense , our company 's website should have been the very best image of our company .  In conclusion , for the reasons stated above , I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . On the other hand , I seem to have to learn that products in the advertisement are not as good as they really are when I do the shopping .	JPN
There is no doubt that learning academic subjects is very good at the begnning of learning , but ithink learning aspecific subject after that is very important .  I think learning one specific subiect we will be more creative in this kind of subject or field . And ihave my self for example , ispecialized in teaching and ithink i became avery creative teacher , and ithink ibecame one of the most greatest teachers in my country . As aspecialized theacher , i managed to add anew ideas for the teaching , a new meathods , anew tools and avey great things to my students .  I believe , by learning aspecific subject we will be able to find the creative doctors , like my brotherfor example , he becam one of the most famous doctors in my country , one of the most creative and successful doctors every where in my country and ithink this is because his choice to study one specific subject which is medicine .  In concolusion , ithink every one should choose one specific subject to learn , and be good in it and creative in it instead of learning too much stuff . Ibelieve also by learning one subject we will find tle creative persons evey where .	ARA
I agree that young people do not give enough time to help their communities in these days . People have to work individually , but they also should work for the group that they are a member of . Not a spesific group I mean , they have to participate in public , for example in a school , or in a family . Teenagers are not familiar with their responsibilities as a student and also as a family member .  Usually , people start learning to be a part of community in a family . Children should study lessons , show respect to older members , when parents should work for the family , and help their children to become a better adult . Besides the general idea , they also have to love each other and should have a good relationship . Unfortunately , young people avoid to be closer to their parets . They do n't listen the advices an experienced adult can give , instead they start getting away from their home . Teenagers even want to be with their unknown friends , rather then spending time with their brothers or sitsters .  Another example where young people show responsibility is their schools . They have to participate to classes , study for exams and also study for the future to get a good job . Recently , students think school is somewhere to get away from home , or have fun without any preparing for lessons . They see the rules as challanges that they have to break and get attention . Then school diciplines have more strict rules to control them . So the community they try to work fells apart . Teenagers should give some of their freedom to have a peaceful school life .  To conclude , young people should sometimes act like a grown up to control their lives better . If they can be a good student , friend , sister/brother , daughter/son , they can create a better community and they also can enjoy where they are and what they are doing .	TUR
It is absolutely true that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they reallly are . But how this happens ? That is not an easy is question to answer , but I think this is also the only question to make in order to understand why advertisements have this particular effect .  I believe that the main strategy used by market analysts is simply to influence people by touching their weaknesses . Everyone of us for example , or at least most of us , wants to be accepted by society ( our group of friends or our collegues ) . It is un unconscious process but it is like that , and we can do nothing against it . As a consequence of this process we tend to buy the products that we feel could change in a better way the conception that the other have of us ; any object that could improve of our social image is certainly to be bought .  I will try to make an example . If I know that David Beckam shaves with a particular aftershave I might think that by using that specific product I will achieve the same social approval he has .  That is why most advertisements use famous people to sponsorize a product : because we unconsciously want to be like them . Any way , the question is whether there is a solution to this kind of problem , it is in fact a problem the one we are talking about , because linked to a weakness of modern social communities .  I simply think that , considered that we can not change the entire costumes of our society , the starting point is being aware of this fact . This way of reasoning will make us more critics on advertisments , whose products will seem no more as attractive as we thought they were before .	ITA
There is one or two thing make a country more powerfull and more beatiful . On of them is young people in the country . If they can work for their communities good they can make their country very beautiful too . However i think its so hard to set young people for this type actions . Because they grow up so stupidly and so lazy . They have been train from their parents to act like these .  At this time young people start to think their self more than otherthing when they are a little child . They force their family to do their wants with crying and other things to whichs are family dont see in their child . They act like this beause families dont give them to thinkings to understand what happened in the world and what should them do to survive in this wolrd . They grow up and enter a world which they dont know to live with . They are not ready to see real world how can they live in this world . They did more thing when they are growing but they dont give time to understand their communities . So how can they help to their communities even if they dont know their communities requirements . Howevet i think this is not young adults faults . This is their parents fault , this is fault of who manage their country or their world .  Because of all of these young people do not give time to helping their communities . Yes i accept this 's not all of their faults . They can easily trained to be good child , good citizen and so good people . We can solve this problem with some formules if we are really want to solve this . We can give our teens responsibility to their communities . We can give them good opportunities to think more and help their communities .	TUR
This sentence is truth in part . Because more young people use their time for helping their communities or the person that have need . This young are a good choise , because use part of their time or the time of holidays , for bring to help to the people .  More young helping their communities with the volontarity in Croce rossa or 118 , in turn , other in `` oratorio '' , or `` summer center '' , or help center for children with problems , or in `` case di cura '' for handicap people or old people .  I know more friends that spent their time for this work , for enjoing the anlike people . This young are a hope for this people , they can bring a smile . They spent their time with people need , and they enough . I agree this choice this young people because I use my holiday to help the children with some problems , not in Italy , but in others country , when the help is need . I prefer the children because are fantastic , and teaching more .  But I do n't agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because as always there is who that helping other or your communities and who prefer to spent his time in others mode .  As in all there is good and no good . I hope that the adult o old people see this young . More young good people existent too !	ITA
The author says that young people enjoy life more than older people do .  Yes i will agree to these statement because older people came from younger generation only , hence it is possible to agree the statement .  Firstly , young people will enjoy more than older people because from the early age of the born baby he dont know about life after some years child will go to school which is institution and from there he knows some things and after when he will become to a certain position h e will be enjoying with his friends and as well as they will be close to each other aswell as they help each other and it is important for every person .  Hence it is must because when he will be in problem friends will only help some times parents will not do that time and hence it happens when it is true friend ship . when there will be any occasions all the friends will meet they will enjoy with party and all will celebrate and enjoy and that is the age to enjoy the life and do whatever he wants because the past never comes and such a way that all should enjoy .  Whenever there is a holiday people will go to cinema that it will be full entertainment as well as games like cricket all will play if they have holidays it is nice and interesting game and going to picture with friends is a nice enjoyment , all will be happy at that movement , and they will dance in theatres and it is a nice enjoyment and hence in every festival all the friends will meet and they will spend there day at that place .  While in a college there will be a competitions , sports , entertainment and we can participate and enjoy and we can go to tours with college or with our own way for a week there fore we can enjoy the climate in the same while enjoying we should also study .  While exam date will come near we should preapare for exams and also we should prepare well for the exams if we dont know any thing our friends will be helpful in such a way that we can write exams succesfully .  Whereas older people can not do this which means while come to an older age they should not eat every item and they should take medicine daily it is a problem and also for them there will be tensions and they will be in hurry in each field . hence atlast i says that older people also come from younger age and they also enjoyed , but it is fact every person should enjoy his life in a successful way .

To be afraid to do something new is inerent to all hummans . Failing is a very unpleasent thing and the best way to avoid failing is not to do anything . But if history has teach us something is that the only way to improve and be successful is to try new things and take risks , no matter how hard or painful this might be .  The western world as we know it , came hand by hand with the industralization . This period of the history is known to be time where steam and dreams made able massive productions , better goods and incrisse in quality of life . Without people taking risk and failling hundreds of times before finding solutions , none of these could happened .  Another good example of the results of risk taking actions is the development of the airplanes . Probably all of us have seen some old movies of the first plane prototypes . Crazy machines that look more like games than real planes . But after years of trail and error someone got it right . And thanks to that , it is possible to travel in hours to places that otherwise would be impossible to reach .  I have apersonal personal exaple , as a Brand Manager of a wine company . No one believed that we could develop a wine to be as fun as beer . `` It is simply not wine essence to be fun '' an important manager ones said . But me and my team strongly believed that it was possible to do it . So after a lot of mistakes we finally developed `` FRESSCO '' a new brand that combines wine with fresh fruit in a completelly innovative packaging . The results , FRESSCO is now one of top 3 wines sold in Chile and it has become a real competitor to beers .  So , concluding , even if been afraid to do something new is always a challenge for any person , is fundamental to know that innovation is the only way to progress . It is true , mistakes can really be painful , but the reguard of doing something new compensates all .	SPA
I completely agree that students should pay more emphasis to understanding ideas and concepts rather than superficially mugging up facts . A mugged up fact with no basic understanding of the idea behind it may seem less time-consuming initially , may enable you score quite well also but in the long run it does no good to you . For . e.g. in a maths test in primary if you merely cram all word problem solutions , then please be ready to cram another set of word probelms in primary 6 , 7 , so on . . But if you have understood the concept , you just need to apply the same . And score A in all the classes . This is my personal experience . Primary 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , I only studied word probelms in primary 6 and never thereafter . Merely cramming not only hinders your clear vision towards the matter but also blocks your mental ability to think deeper and in a way blocks your mental growth . If we dont ask ourselves questions about subject and donot try to find out answers we are blocking our own vision . For e.g. if Newton didnot ask himself or make himself to think of why the apple fell , he would not have gone to find out answers and give his theory . Deeper understanding of a matter not only enables you clearly understand but on its own or in other words automatically generated your interest into a subject . And what better than this if you are really enjoying what you are doing ? Every art comes with practice , demands time , devotion and , of course , interest . Learning , not only painting , but infact doing science is an art as well . For e.g. , if in your secondary school you learn and understand what titration is conceptually , you will definitely enjoy the moments spent in chemistry lab when you are performing it with your own hands and then seeing pH becoming neutral . Another interesting example is that of understanding cancer . If you really understand what is the cellular mechanism of cancer and what genes or proteins are increased or decreased during the process , it will be so fascinating to study the response or development of cancer merely by studying the levels of genes and then see the results and then understand them also and then make others to look at what results you have got in your laboratory with appropriate explanations and relate them to cancer , rather than merely acting as a foolish worker in your own lab . Learning a technique makes you merely a worker , as good as a blue collar guy , learning a subject makes you a scientist . So in-depth knowledge is not important but mandatory . Mugging or learning facts makes you a worker but to really enjoy and rule a subject one should understand the concepts which is something that is going to take one a long way .	HIN
I believe everybody can not know everything and its not so good to be ` Jack of all trades and master of none ' . Specific knowledge is very much desired in both professional and academic fields .  Specialized knowledge of the subject is many times indispensible . One good example would be from field of medicines , where general Physicians are valued but specialist like Cardiologists or Neurologists are indispensible and are the final option for particular kind of treatments .  Too much generalized knowledge may become very superficial and will not be of much help in solving complex problems in specific subjects . For instance , if we look at the field of science , say Biology , a generalized understanding of all its branches is required but a Taxonomist and a Biophysicists have very less to do with each others and can not help each other in solving their specific problems .  However all this discussion is not meant to diminish the value of general knowledge , as for application of knowledge from one subject in to other requires understanding of both . For example if principles of Mathematics are to be applied to Biology then general knowledge of both subjects is required . However it will be done more appropriately if two specialists i.e. A Biologist and a Mathematician interact with each other .  Also i believe that human memory has its limitations and one should use it judiciously . We should confine and focus our brains towards solving problems related to specific subject . Too much unnecessary knowldge will occupy space in one 's memory and will not be put to use very often .  Therefore having General knowledge in moderation is good , but having only general knowledge is of no use . To apply knowledge for usefull purpose one has to specialize in particular subject .	HIN
I agree with the statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Here are the reasons why .  First , advertisement tend to over exeggerate the effect of the product . For example , many cosmetics claim in their advertisements that they have speical elements that make your skin white within just two weeks or make your face looks better . When you see the advertisement you will be attracted by the slogans or marvel at its magical effect , and you will buy it . There 's no solid evidence or medical reports that proves that the product is that useful , but the advertisements often use beautiful models and exaggerate speech to convince you to buy the product .  Second , the advertisement is a work being thoroughly and specially designed . Through the lightening and computer adjustments , the product can be seen perfect in the advertisements . Take the shampoo advertisement as an example , the model 's hair always look so shining and smooth in the ads after they use the shampoo . However , the hair is very artificial . There is no way people 's hair can be that perfect , but the company that produces the shampoo spends a huge amount of money on the filming to make you believe that their shampoo is really that good .  Finally , the advertisement is often selling a concept of lifestyle , not the product itself . It is not the product that is apealing , but the ideal lifestyle beneath it that attracks you . The product can be bad , but as long as you want to have the lifestyle that the advertisement promote , you will buy the product . For instance , in a house ads that emphasize on the idea that single woman can live alone happily , the house itself is not that important . It is the wish to live as a happy single noble that makes you want to buy the house .  To conclude , the advertisement is a carefully designed work that promotes concept and often exegerates the product . Thus , it makes the products seem much better that they really are .	CHI
Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . Is this statement right or not ? I think it is quite difficult to answer this question . If I think of my grandmother , was she really more involved in their community ? It is possible that at the time , when my grandmother was young , kids and teenagers may have done more for their community . For example people in these days organised events for the whole community , they were together in a social community and helped each other , wherever they could . But this statement can be made for all people of my grandmothers village , not only for young people . On the other side my grandmother and also the other children in her age had to work a lot at home and on the field . So they did not have a lot time to spend together or to do things for their community .  Furthermore I think nowadays young people are also social active . It depends more , where they are living . In rural societies , in a small village for example , the connection between the inhabitants is much closer , than in urban areas . In a big city , in Zurich for example , people do not spend a lot of time in helping others . As bigger a city is the more individual and isolated people are . Thy do not have enough time and also not enough connection with others . And the consequence of this individualism and this isolation is that people , expecially young people , are not integrated in the whole society , they have only their peers , but they are not much connected with , or related to people form different ages or different social and educal backgrounds . This people do not even think about helping their communities . But that is not their problem , that is the problem of the whole society and the difference between urban and rural life .	GER
I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for many reasons .  First , we a very new to the place and if we a in a group there are very less change to get lost in the unknow place . It is better to have a group . We can enjoy the site by sharing our own ideas with the other preson . In a group they can take good care of the other preson if they r not well .  Second , having a tour guide is the best way to travel . Guide is the person how is very familier with the place so he can help us to now the history of the place . He ( guide ) also take us to the very important places , which we can not find them with ourself . He also help us in selecting the place to rest and have great food .  Third , people make many good friends in the tour . In a group no one feels bore of the tour ; because in the free time they can enjoy by dancing , singing around the campus fire .	TEL
It is really important to have a broad knowledge , but it ' s true that in this age we also need person who are specialise in one specific subject . This problem begin to appear when you finsh the hight school and , I think , t it never disappear .  I sad that is important to have a broad knowledge because ony if you have taste a lot of different thinghs you can really chose one of this thinghs . You have to decide and fell wath is the subject that you prefer , that you like and only when you have really understand it you can go on and specialize in it .  To specialize is the secon step . This is really important because in this period the word move quikly and we need that people organizeing themself in sector . We need that people do their works at the best level and , for this reason , people need to specialise themself . For example , an economist must kow mats and economy history ec . . very well , so he has to study a lot this specific subject .  At the same time he also have to know other knowledge , not because our sistem want it , but because I think that if we want to became a complet person we must have an open mind and to have broad knowledge is a way to open our mind .  In my opinion this is an instrument whit wich we can change the future .	ITA
People do not always reach success by trying new things and taking risks , even though sometimes it is necessary . If someone has the formula for success , whether he/she found it or is given by the environment , he/she should not change it unless wanting or pushed to do so .  Carlo Ancelotti , coach of AC Milan , an italian soccer team that has won several tournament and awards under his guide , declared on the day before the final of the Champions League `` a team that wins never changes ( set up ) . '' The next day , using the same players as the previous game , AC Milan won the Champions League , the most prestigious tournament in soccer . Just like Carlo Ancelotti suggested , something successful should often remain uncorrupted to succeed again .  Not everyone , though , already has this oppurtinity in his/her life . This is the case when a person should shold try new things and take risks . For instance , considering a large and profitable factory , the son of the boss will not have trouble in order to reach working success ( considering this is the kind of success he is looking for ) as his eritage includes a business already started and well run , but one of the workers in the factory has great manual skills , but in the factory he does not gain much profit and does not fully use the resources he has . If he never took a risk and never tried anything new , he would always work in the same factory and hardly reach success . Instead , if he decided to start his own activity , taking the risks that such a choice bring , he would have a much larger chance to succeed .  Nevertheless , looking at the society in a bigger scale , risks might be necessary to succeed and develop . In fact there is one important factor to consider : competition . The pushing force for many people is often other candidates , who try to reach success by doing something innovative . Unfortnately , there are times where the success of one is the unsuccess of others . This cycle infact is infinite . The positive aspect of this situation is that the society will always offer newer and more innovative things .  Therefore success is not always found by doing something new and taking risks , bet there are times where the situation requires it .	ITA
I agree with this statement . I think that young people enjoy life more than older people . There are two reasons . One reaso is that young people are more activity than older people . Also , the other one is that young people have new ideas for life .  First of all , young people are more activity than older people . It 's because young people can do dance more activity than older people . However older people ca n't do dance more activity than young people . It 's becuse older people do n't have enough power of dancing for a long time .  Second of all , young people have some new ideas for enjoying in life . For example , there is festival in life . Young people can open up thier ideas for festival . It 's because young people can think of interesting ideas .  In conclusion , young people can enjoy in life .	JPN
The New Things  I agree if you try new things and take more risk you can achieve your goals and earn big moneys . I am talking abaout money because my major is a international trade in my university and i would like to do this business buying an d selling somethings . I know how to do this job but i think trying new things for instance you can buy another product and you can change it and sell . It has more risk , may be you can not sell cahanged product .  Successfull people in my country always trying new things for their goal . They are sometimes loosing but if they win , they would have more profit . For example , Its a biggest turkish company . First its a shoe company , they produce shoes and export it . They know how to do well shoes . One day the owner who has a company tried another things they sell all of his property ( his factory , his business , his car , etc . ) And he bought a land for produce onion . He doesnt know anything about how to produce onion , how to sell . ? ts like a gambling . He found a farmer who is living in a rural place . He helped to produce onion and selling process . And they found small packages for onions . For example 1pound , 3 pounds packages and they sold directly markets . It makes more profitable and more usefull for consumers . And he has a onion brand name . Now the ex shoe producer has a big onion 's farms and he earns 1 billion dollar a year , he is exporting onions all over the world its a big deal .  In my opinion trying new things and take a risks are not good for everyone because you need a little bit good luck in your business life .	TUR
Different approaches in education discuss wether it is more important for the students to learn about facts or to understand ideas . If one has to choose between both of them , I would say it is more important to learn to understand ideas . I will first present some arguments to support this point , emphasizing on the intellectual importance of the ideas . Then , I will try to explain how complementary are these points and why they are necessary to any good student .  As a student myself , I feel very concerned by this topic , especially because I am a young researcher and the relationship between concepts and facts is critical . However , mainly because facts can be learn outside the school I would agree to state it is more important to understand concepts . For instance , in my own research about the gentrification of Harlem , I am less interested by the facts and the details than by understand the whole process and the trends which drive it . It is true it is very important to understand the concepts of class , place and territory ( their role , symbols etc ) . I think it the role of the school to learn to the students to think by themselves and it succeed giving them the intellectual and conceptual keys and tools to understand a problem , and solve it .  However , saying the concept is more important than the fact ( as it implied in the question ) I face a big ethic problem . In effect , how can you understand a concept or an idea if you do n't know some facts to contextualize it for example . Even if facts can be learned differently than in an academic way , they are required . For example , if I do n't know how many people are displaced by the gentrification or in what extent the rents rised due to the gentrification , how can I expect to understand the nature of the transformations occuring in the neighborhood ? I think concepts and facts are linked and the reciprocity of their relation is the secret of a good understanding of concepts and ideas .  To conclude , I would say that theorically understand concepts is more important but it only can work with very abstract object of study . The reality is more complex and to understand efficiently an idea , you need to know the context and the facts .	FRE
If your goo what you already know your not successful you are just precise . Their are a bunch of people that are good in what they already know but one makes successful people outstand is their ability to do things that they do not know .  Successful people try new things and take risks because this is what makes them successful persons . If your good at something and you keep doing what you know you are not opening your horizons , you just stay in your comfort zone . To be successful is to take risk , to be something more than ordinary . Successful people try new things because if not they would not be successful persons they would be precise . To be precise is not a bad thing because you are good at what your doing , that is part of being a successful person , but it does not make you a successful person because you can not do more ore simply do not know more , and that is why being precise is not being a successful person .  I agrre that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . People who are successful are good at everything the aim to be good at	SPA
The topic under discussion is whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not . I go with the opinion that the advertisements are making the product look much better than what it actually is .  The growth of the communication media widely in the form of Television , News Papers , Internet and various other choices had lead to an outright growth in the propaganda of any item . People come to know about any new product in the market through any of these media .  The mind set of the people has changed variabily in the sense that they shifted their sides from buying the required ones to the ones that were advertised by the celebrities . Gone were the days when people used to go outdoor shopping to get the required products . The new era has just begun through the interenet shopping where it reduces the burden to go out and shop . People can sit in their homes and if they find something interesting in the adverstiments they opt to buy it through internet .  The previous notion of buying the product based on its requirement and merit has totally changed . People changed their mind set to buy the products that seemed appealing and interesting in the advertisements .  As an example consider the good olden days when there were not many of these advertisements for a product . People used to get a clear understanding of the product they were buying and then opt for that . Now a days the scenario has changed where people buy the product only beacuse their favourite celebrity has advertised that product .  Furthermore people are more interested in buying the item his neighbour has just bought . They consider to be one step higher than them and buy that product even if it is irrelavent to them . In this way mouth to mouth media created problems .  These advertisements are now a days making the products look much more valuable than what they really are . Going through various advertisements provided through the communication media and opting to buy a product is not a wise decission . These advertisements generally hype the product . One comes to know the seriousness of the mistake he has committed in opting for the product with the only impression of the advertisements when once he receives the original product . Next time he might be careful enough in selecting the products to buy .  So in my opion it is always better to select a product basing on its merit rather than following the advertisements and selecting the product .	TEL
I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements ( ads . ) make products seem much better that they in fact are . In my opinion many times ads . fail to meet the spectations created when you finally get or check what advertised . Ads . have many times very few to do with reality because of several reasons . I will discuss about some of them from my point of view .  First of all , the current tough competition for almost every product in the economy makes the companies exaggerate the benefits or characteristics of their products . Every company shows their products in the ads . as the best and far away better than the others made by competitors . When I was a child many times I got dissapointed with most ot the toys I received as gifts at birthdays , those toys seemed to be much bigger on TV that in my hands .  Another point has to do with quality . Many times the quality you get is much worst that what is offered or suggested in ads . For example the sport shoes never last me so longer than I expect from the ads . I see and the price I pay for them .  Moreover another issue is customer service of service given to customer once he or she bought something . In ads . most of the companies focusses on their quality and responsibility . Unfortunately most of the times you can not get easily a satisfactory reply to one question or complaint raised . I faced bad experiences with the call centers of the telecom companies wasting a lot of time and money in uselless reclamations .  Another trick used by ads . is the way those ads . are showed . Normally on TV you can see gorgeous people or aggressive music , so you rather pay attention to the person or musich announcing the item than the annonced item itself . Linked to this is when famous people as actors , actresses , film makers , sportmen or sportwoman are used in the ads .  To sum up , I do not believe what is showed in the ads . since they make the producs be more attractive than they really are . Ads . are not factual most of the times .	SPA
In my opinion , I agree with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group which led by a tour guide . And my reason is basic on following reasons .  Firstly , traveling with a tour group is safer than traveling alone , being taken by a tour guide , you can go to anywhere which have security garentee , otherwise , it is dangerous for you to go to a strange city without someone taking you .  Secondly , a tour guide can tell you were to go and what to see , obviously , they know better than we do , being taken by a tour guide , you can make your trip worth , and you wo n't wast your money which you spend on this trip .  Thirdly , if you go to a foreign country where the people speak foreign language that you ca n't understand , it will be very difficult for you to communicate with others when you want to buy someting or ask fordirections , in that case you need a tour guide to help you .  In conclution , it is better for us to have a tour guide and travel in group , because it 's safer , and you can receive more help .	CHI
If i was asked wheather I prefer try new things or dont try , I would prefer try new things for three reasons .  First , to try new things may have a lot of hard experiences and a lot of risks . I think to change ever own thinking is too difficult . If my age would have been more higher , it would be more and more difficult . But I will be able to get more highly advantage . To get more highly advantage , For example I can change more high saralley work and get more bigger house .  Second , to try new things will be able to connect many new networks . For example , work , friend , own lifestyle and so on . To get more intelligent friends may be bright own life . And if I had very difficult problems on my life , they would have a good advice for me . For example , work , relationship for friends and so on .  Third , to try new things may get more excensitive mind . To try more difficult ploblem will be able to change more strongly own heart . To get more strongly heart will be able to communicate for many kinds of people , I think .  So , I think to try new things is more better than not to try . I think to serrect many things , is to good for my final life	JPN
Communities have lots of problems about improvements . The governments major duty to make a community better . However nowadays lots of young communities are trying to make their community better . These young people help their community by improving the schools and taking part in a social group .  Firstly , young people are eager to improve the schools where they get their education . These people take part in a building society to rebuild the old schools and they also take part in a society which is about old books . This community collects the old books from different schools and then they exchange them from the libraries . Moreover they help people who is duty is about cleaning environment . For instance these young people help these people to make their environment to be a clearer place by helping them and also planting trees to the empty places .  Secondly , young people take part in social groups which are about helping old and poor people . Young people make arrangements and some organizations help these people by collecting the ticket fees . Nowadays we can see hundreds of social group which help to improve their communities by arranging these type of organizations . In this type of organizations these young people earn lots of money . However this money can not be paid to old and poor people by the young people . They use this money about this poor people 's clothing and also about their food .  In conclusion , nowadays there are lots of young people who are eager to help and improve their environment and communities . It makes community a better place by rebuilding the schools and helping old and poor people by collecting money from some organizations . However there are lots of awareness people , we can improve our community by doing the same jobs like these young people .	TUR
Yes i do agree with the statement Most adverstisement make product seem much better than they really are because without having advertisement how can we know about the product . For example take product like oats which is used as food item we can have with hot water and mixing milk and sugar , it can be shown as a TV add by playing a role by reputated person like sports , film actor and like model . play must be for 30 secs only in that we must show all types things like what oats contains and how it is usefull for daily used people by prefoming and add with in 30 sec showing the embalem of the product . The advertisement should be shown globally to people .  Giving advertisement for a product it gives complete picture or use of the product which should be seen by people . Product should have import and export value by their demand .  The product should gain the demand by showing proper advertisements . People should have proper idea on the product they should believe it by seeing proper advertisement . Means advertisement should impress the demanders . Advertisements should be shown globally , there we can find the demand .  Advertisements should have proper theam which impress consumer and they should attract by seeing that , There are many ways to sell the product by giving attractive gifts on using advertisements , showing that if product is buyed you can have gift coupons of worth of x / Rs . The whole advertisement should take abcitvate and should gain more demand .  Advertisements plays an major role to sell a product . because product should show in real and caption shown below with small letter that indicates these play is performed by experts so please u do not follow the same , Means it incdicates true but not real .  One good examples is that cigar sellings are shown on TV advertisements but on packets it will retuen SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH . The best example for advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	TEL
Nowadays advertisement is very important . When we look around we can see easily that the type of advertisement is developed , because the technology is developed very quickly . When I open the TV I can see many different and interesting advertisement . . If one peson want to be successful they must make a good advertisement . On the other hand , they must pay much money . Therefore we shoudl prepare an advertisment for making a good product .  First reason is curoisity . Generally everbody waches television every night . The advertisement give many opinion about product and in the television we can make many changlable point that is shape colour or size . For example ; when I watch advertisement I want to use these product because in the tv the shape and the coluor is very attractive .  Secon reason is that in the advertisemnt we can see famous people . I believe that it is very important because many people like to watch famous people . These type of advertisement is expensive but I believe that it is not important beceause in the future , we will gaigne much maney . For example ; last week my sister wanted to buy coca - cola because she saw the famous peole in the advertisement . So the emotional intelligence is very important in the advertisement . Advertiser should find many different types of advertisement when they prepare the project .  As a resault , there are many reaosons for making a good advertisment . When we read the examples in the passage we can see easily that the advertisemnt is very important for product . If we give many importances of the advertisement I believe that product became popular .	TUR
I agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they realy are . Advertisements are there to attract customers to a certain product . The product is always displayed in a way where it seems appeling to the viewer . Sometimes the company advertising the product tend to exadurate in advertising . They make the product seem to good to be real . Each advertisement is there to target a certain age group . For example when advertising a toy on the television certain sound effects and bright colours are used to attract young children making them desire the product . Therefore the parents take action and buy the toy for their child . Advertising is the best way to minpulate with young children 's minds .  Advertisements does not include the disadvantages of the product advertised . The product is always praised and made flawless . The company advertising a certain good main aim is profit . Quality and customer service is the last thing considered . It is rare that you find an advertised product that is trustworthy and is exactly like it was described on the advertisement .  In a conclusion i would like to say that the problem we are facing nowadays is that we are letting those false advertisements affect us , but there is nothing we can do about it as they are every where . They 're displayed as bulletin boards in the streets , showed on the television as commercials and even played on the radio . In the end were just humans and the least things affect us !!!	ARA
For as long as this sophisticated society has existed , people have debated which advertisements effectively work to attract consumers . Although this issue may never resolved to everyone 's satisfaction , the matter is very clear in my mind : I disagree with this statement . Many advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are .  That not all advertisements success to attract consumers is evident for several reasons . To begin with , some advertisements discourage people to purchase the products . To illustrate , in many countries , the advertisements of tobbacos have warming sentences on them . When I traveled in Australia , I detected that even the photos of lung cancers were used in the advertisements . In this case , the advertisements warn us the possibility of danger that is caused by using the products . Indeed , the advertisements of tobbacos do not makes products better .  Furthermore , some advertisements utilize an unique strategy to attract consumers . For example , Yukiguni-maitake , Japanese food products company , uses the conspicuous strategy : Its advertisement says that do not buy its products . This advertisement is unusual , therefore , many consumers are attracted and finally buy the products . In view of this , the advertisements sometimes apply unique strategy which does not appeal merits of the products .  Nevertheless , some critics claims that the advertisements ' role is to appeal the products . However , the fact , as detailed above , reveals that some advertisements try to prevent customers from buying their products .  In conclusion , I believe that the advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers . It is clear from my examples .	JPN
I disagree with this statement . There are some disadvantages for having a trip in a group I think . First it is quite difficult for in a group to decide the best destination everyone feels satisfied with . Second during a trip in a group , we can not have a trip in the way we each like . I think such a trip is far from enjoyment and relax . We need to think well about the true purpose of trip . Travering definitely is not getting stress . In a group we can not help but feel certain stress . It is better for us not to have a trip if it applies to us . On the other hand , having a trip by myself I think I can make my trip meaningful , free from stress and of course fun . There are some reasons for this . First I can go to the destination which I think I want to visit . Second , I do not have to care about other people . In such a situation I can enjoy seeing sights for much time which I thought would like to more . That is why I think the best way yo enjyo a trip is to do it by myself .	JPN
In the everchaging world new products are devloped and with new features that customers demand that their products should accomplish and due to increase in the companies and their produts each one want to increse their share and want to dominate the market , advertisements seem to play key role in sale of the product  I agree with the fact that the advertisements make products seem better that actually they are . In order to trap the customers the comapny show the produts in a great manner they give great publicity and employ celebrities in publicing them ultimatly when customer buys the product and then what happens ?  the customer feels cheated and he becomes red on the comapny for example , it was told buy a company in the part of their publicity stunt to have an upper hand over thier commpetiotors they have produced a bike that would give a mailage of 120km / liter of petrol to attract the customers they have hidden the truth that they have overstated the mileage many of the customers bought the the bike they practically experince it by riddng the bike what they have felt that that the product is under perfoming , they went to the comapny and asked for the fact but the comapny officials seemed that they responce was not upto the mark what the customers expected the went to the customer court and thay got their money back .  In the above stated example the case gives a vey good lime light into the topic , that is right that the comapny lost lot of money in paying thier money and in insted it got a bad fame and any person doesnt even think having that comapnys product  The comany feel that publicity is every thing , they think that seeing is beliving , they are in that vision and advertise hugely on the qualities and standards that the product doesent accomplish , but in reality seeing is not everythging we might belive , usually we should not belive in every thing we see .  comanys should be transparent and shoul advertise what the product does really have in order to have long term good relatiopn with the customer and maintining a good name of the company .

An anecient Arabic says `` take whole things from a particular thing , and take something from all things . '' Having a broad knowledge of many acadimic subject is better than stay on one speclizie subject for many reasons that strict scinces , provied another scinctist and expand personal awareing .  First , sinces are complacated and crossed . By way of example , there is a crossed between Law and Political , so any specilist who interest in Law needs to study a little about political . And there are many scinces which concrated from many scinecs , such as , Piochimestry , Economy law ,  Furthermore , specilist needs to know some information about board scinces to biuld bridges with another specilist , he and another people need each other to provide thier knowlodge , experinces , resaerches . For example , pofessor of Physics will get a lot of benifit from professor of Math , that will encourge thier ideas and theoris , so  Moreover , a broad knowlodge expand awareing of mind , it gives a lot of information that can not be in a similar labs which specilist stay in . As example , professor of Law can not know any things about periods of arabic poets if he does net deal with Arabic Letrituer professor . Also he can enjoy in peoples inventions , and he gets more angles view to life .  As a result , I agree to having broad knowledge because it has a lot of advanteges , change realtionship between scinctist , and expand awaing .	ARA
To choose between a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or a good specialization in only one specific subject is not easy , as both possibilities have advantages and disadvantages . Anyway I agree with the idea that it-s better to have a broad knowledge of several different subjects , and that for several reasons .  First of all , a person with a variety of interests and knowledges in different fields is probably a person with an open mind who shows a strong intellectual curiosity . Famous intellectuals of the past , like Leonardo Da Vinci , just to name one of the most known , had an incredible variety of knowledges and curiosities . Then , having a broad knowledge of the world in general might help people in their carreer and professional life . Also , having a good knowledge in a variety of subjcts doesn-t necessarily mean that a person can-t have a special field of interest in which he or she is more competent .  An open mind and a broad culture can be a great advantage in a fast changing world as the one we live in today . In fact we must be ready and able to adapt to different situations and conditions .  On the contrary , if we are too rigid , if we are overspecialized in a very particular field , we might be unable to get the whole picture , so to speak , and we might be less flexible , less able to cope with any change we can have to deal with in our lives . Of course there-s nothing wrong with being very good in a particular subject we like more . I think that only overspecialization is wrong . If someone is competent and interested only in a very special field , he or she might be very good in his or her job , but might not be able to adapt or to react to situations that require a more general approach .  Sometimes you read on papers of terrible mistakes doctors do in their work , as not understanding exactly a patient-s desease or simply confusing symptoms described by patients . That can be due to the fact that some doctors are extremely well prepared in their field , but are sometimes unable to analize the whole situation , and they might miss the fact that they are dealing with people and not just with sick kidneys or livers , to give an exemple .  For all said reasons , I do believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects and keeping the curiosity and passion for learning all our life is definitely better that limit our knowledges only to a specific field of study .

I disagree about that `` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities '' . Because the helping poeple is not for others . It means if you helping people those people help back to you . Good friends are good communities , good communities are helping your life forever .	JPN
My opinion about the topic that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is ambuoules . On the one hand i think many of young people are egoistic today , on the other I know that it is not easy to manage social ambitions today , espacially for the youth . I can imagine the young pepole because Iam one of them .  I do not help in my community or neither I work in a social programm . The reasons for that are my few time between the duty 's wich filling my whole day . I think the possibilty to help without any pay in communities is better at a younger age of children , from eleven till fifteen . Many older young people are busy with their education and own future and too young children maybe are not in the confidence or have the responsibility to work for the community .  Many of the work wich is to do in a german communities is made by so called young people who finished school . If thez do n't want to go to the army , they can choose a social work in communities , hospitals , etc . . The truth is that young people do n't help for free . They are always looking for a payment and do n't do anz help benfitly . Iam sure that there are many things wich young people could do in a community	GER
The most important time  Nowadays , most of young people do not have enough time to have their own time . Some students can not have time for their own work or rest as their parents does not allowed or they have really busy schedule for study . So I think young people does not have enough time to help their communities . Now I want to talk about the time as they have and the reason why I think young people do not have time .  I have seen many students who spend hard time to study their school work and keep their busy schedules . I think the students have to have enough time to help their communities . It is because during they are helping their communities , they can get lots of life experiences which give them more important knowledge than the study in their school . Some times life experiences bring really important things to people to know for their life . Also the communities are important just like life experience . They will get many thing which they want to know , when they are talking or chetting with others and friends . For example , if we study with others , we can get much imformations which very useful than studying by our selves . Nowadays , our life is changing and people can not get their own time anymore . Also young people are busy to live in these days and it is same happening to students .  In my opinion , if we have free time to communicate with people and have some rest time , even if we have busy schedule , it will bring better conditions and results to them . I believe that if they have time to help their communications , they will get clear idea to study more effectively with better conditions .	KOR
I agree with the people now is very busy to think about to offer some help . It is very important to understand that today the world is very competitive , and young people have to be dedicated on his learning , developing their skills and improving their capacity to answer the demand of new professionals . However is truth that exist another kind of people that are very comprometive with the situation of the others and the mayority of this persons are young people .  This world is very complicated and is very difficult to achieve the individuals goals . People have to work very hard , they do not have any time to breath , to stop and to think in another situation . The life is taugh and they have to give an answer about what is their role today . People try to have success , try to demostrate their worth and work to be the best .  They have to study , next to find a good job and to survive into this competitive world . Them they have very tired to spend their time in another task . They do not have too much time and they know it .  However today the things have been changed . Actually young people , start to be more compromited with helping their communities . They use to take part in different events , and participate in various associations . There are alot of people developing jobs that have very relation with voluntaries activities . The reality of this time is that there are people who want to colaborate and serve .  I think that today beging to be a new kind of people , vey responsible with the social situation and very identified with teh situation of another people .	SPA
The school provides a good environment for the students to be educated . Some people emphasizes the great importance for the students to understand ideas and concepts in their school settings , while others argue that the significancy of learning facts should not be neglected . As far as I see it , it would be more reasonable for the school to teach their students more about how to understand the ideas and concepts . Some of my reasons are given below .  The main reason for my propensity is that the school provides the best environment for the students to understand ideas and concepts , while the facts can be learned by the students themselves through other ways , examples are internet and documentary films . In the classroom , the students can be guided by the teacher , and they can discuss matters with their classmates , which are both of utmost importance for them to understand ideas and concepts . If the teachers just keep tellling the students the facts , the advantage aspect of the school would be wasted . Furthermore , other methods enable the students to learn facts that are far more valuable and more up-to-date . The internet contains much more information than the text books used in the classroom , and the information are likely to be the latest .  Besides , understanding ideas and concepts helps the students to solve more complex problems . As we noticed , the exams nowadays are more flexible , which not only requires the students to list facts printed in the book , but also require the students to make use of their learned ideas and concepts to achieve a higher score . If a high school student can grasp the ideas and concepts in class , he or she will probably get a higher score in the College Entrance Examination , which can exercise a extremely important impact on this student 's future career .  Additionally , were students eager to understand the ideas and concepts , they are more likely to discuss or share their opinions with their classmates and the teaches . That would undoubtedly help the students ' interpersonal communication ability . Moreover , communications can result in friendship . When the students are discussing with each other , they may find something in common between them , or even can become friends owning to it . As the time for them to discuss problems goes by , their friendship is likely to solidified .  Though learning facts is also very important in education , judging from what has been mentioned above , I believe it is understanding ideas and concepts that far outweighs the opposite aspect .	CHI
I agree with this statement because I think that a person who has a different specializations can be help in his / he professional carrer . In fact we can understand how difficult is to found a job and for this reason I think that a person who is able to do a lot of things has some facilitations . Economy and work want that a person is a good worker , with different experiences .  As the matter of fact my opinion is n't correct , in fact I undestand that it is important also that a person is able to do his/her work in a good way and this is possible also if that person is specialized in a particular field .  For all these reasons I think that it is important to have different specializations when a person is looking for a job , but , when he/she found it , she/he must specialize in his/her own work .  Sometimes it is not requested a licence in a particular field . A simple course can help you to found a job . So I think that it is important to know different subjects , but this knowing has importance if it is specialized .	ITA
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . This statement is very true as a person who tries to do things differently and takes a different approach towards certain things in life proves to be successful , but the success can not be guaranteed . If a person goes about doing things as he usually does and is perfect at , he will not suffer any loss but will be stable , no growth and no loss , these are the people who like to play it safe in life and lead a life without stress ans tension where as taking risks in life is a stressful thing but you can increase your growth only by trying new things and innovating ideas and ways of doing things . A careful analysis is very important about the type of risk bieng taken and what is the appropriate method for going about the decision . Most business houses have been successful because of their ability to take risks and try innovative strategies and plans . Such people like to enjoy life to the fullest and are determined about what they want in life and work their way upto it .  I believe that people should take risks in life but they also should be careful and know the pros and cons of taking the risk . They should take risk that they can bear . Without taking risks a person acnnot achieve what he wants , he will have to be satisfied with what he has . Only people who have the thirst in them to achieve what they want take risks , some succeed and some fail . Therefore it has to be well strategised and well planned inorder to reach the objective and move ahead in life . Risk has extreme consequences , you either suceed or you fail , so people should take risk knowing what they are getting into . Therefore its not everyone'scup of tea to take risks and those who do not have the heart to bear the loss should not go ahead with it .	HIN
It is age what make our lives , and that is why it is so important to enjoy life . But it is not so easy as it sounds because there are different stages in our lives that come with different things we have to face . And that 's why I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .  When people are jung there are three main aspects that make them enjoy more than when people are old . The first one is the responsabilities they have in their lives . When life is beginning people do n't really have to worry about many things , they normally have their parents or someone that takes care about important aspects of life . And if they have to take responsabilities they have the energy to do it . For example , paying the bills , being responsable for the hause and many others things that need responsability and can cause stress . Another and very important aspect that shows that jung people enjoy more ist health . The jung people normally have no big problems with their health and body in general , they can move by themselves and are able to do things without any physical help . This is very important for us as human beings . The last point is the mentality , or also mental health . This Psycologic aspect also make the jung people enjoy more life because they normally think positively , have dreams , have things to accomplish in their future . And that is also something important , the jung people have expectations and so they can do things to get what they want of their lives , or at least try .  For old people things are not just that easy . They have already been jung and made a lot of things . They have had a lot of responsabilities and now they are tired and need to rest and this aspect makes them have a negative attitude towards life and so they can not see other things to enjoy . At this time of their lives , they do not really have much more energy to continue with all this responsabilities . The second aspect and more important is the physical health . Normally when people reach the old stage of life , they have some kind of limitation that does not permit them enjoy as like when they were jung . Thisngs take more time to be done and maybe thay can not even do them . Finally the mental health , as said befor a positiv mentallity is very difficult to find . Things have changed and being old is not easy . That is why I say that jung people enjoy more than old people , because everything is easier and physically , mentally and in term of responsabilities it is better being jung , you have more thing to enjoy life . Energy ends , and attitude is also a matter	SPA
I agree with the statement that says that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars than there today '' . In fact I have to admit , for my personal experience , that in the last ten years this was the tendence we are achieving , even if it is not a good result .  I think that in twenty years there are going to be fewer cars because of several reasons . First of all the cities are getting bigger . I have read last week that most of the people now live in cities . That means that they are going to have to move inside the city , and as bigger the city becomes , as more people will need to have a car ( unless the State will offer the possibility to move with an alternative transport ) .  Secondly cities are often overcrowded , and people who do not have much money are obliged to find another place where to live out of the city . This means once again that they are going to need a car to get to the city for working , for example . Also there are people that dislike the style of life that often a city offers . They would probably try to find a place where to live that is out of the city , but from where they are able to get to the city by car .  Morover I think it also depends on how the State , or the local community would act . There are several examples that demonstrate that when a local community do not want to have too many cars in the city , some solutions can be found to resolve this problem .  The first thing is to make a good city plan , that can really help . If a city is planned in a smart way that considers different things , as where to put major roads , or how to plan alternative transports , then to move in the city is definitely easier .  Secondly the State should try to sensibilize more and more people that live in the city , who often do not care about this topic because they are more comfortable by moving with their own car or because they think this problem does not affect them . Which is not true , because they do not feel comfortable at all while trying not to get stuck in line or when air pollution reaches really dangerous limits !  Finally I agree with the statement , even if I think that it will be a huge problem if this actually comes true .	ITA
ARE WE HUMAN OR MACHINES ?  Society has been developing in many different ways according to human necesseties . This human vision has gone dissapeard . Actually we move in a very high stressed world , ( obviously , in developed countries ) , that sometimes does not allow to people to increase their human values and their helping in their communities .  Probably , many years ago , young people did not used to do such things that young people , at this moment do . We had more relathionships each other 's and also we had more dependence on the rest of the people . Industrialisation , technical developments , new discovers , independence , competition , stress . .. have really made changing the world .  Firstly , parents want to give to their children all they had n't when they were childs , and in many cases they are making a mistake , and in this way young people ca n't think in things ' values and the cost of them .  Secondly , sometimes children schedule is like a minister schedule . I mean , it seems that they have to full all their time in the whole day , going school , learning music , learning , sports , languages , and many other things that you could imagine . After that , they arrive at home totally exhausted , so they do n't have the strong enough to spend another part of their time helping their communities . At least , this is what is happening in medium class family in Spain , the place where I live .  Thirdly , they have a great adversary , TELEVISION !!! Oh my God !! I think it is the principal and horrible nowadays ' enemy of our young people , they coul spend all theri time watching it .  Finally , I must say that we coul try to avoid many things and to be more creative with our children , and incentivate them to value human relathionships , only in this way they could probably help their communities .

In our childhood , we try to omit other 's behavior and handle new things . We learn how to stand up properly . Sometimes we would fail and cry , but soon we would try again until we succeed . Then , we soon try another new things and get more and more ablility . To me , I believe learning new ablility is a life-long proccess for successful people . We should take risks to try new things in order to succeed because it provides us opportunities to benefit of life , improvement and correction .  Trying new things benefit people 's life because people could gain many usable skills that would be useful in the future . For instance , Bill Gates gathered the valuable knowledge of computing in his early life . He then used this knowledge to establish a unique computing system - Windows . The new ablity allows BIll Gates to be richest man in the world in his later life . Trying new things always let people to gain wealthy . Thus , the people would always pursue in studies even after they have been working for a long time .  When people try new things , they would get improvement that they could not get from doing things already familar . For example , if I read the book which I already read it before , I would probably learn very little or nothing . The book is no use for me . In contrast , if I read a new book about `` How to Straigten Your Personality , '' I may alter my old way of doing things . I could improve my way of  Last but not least , people could make correction while they try the new things . The reason for that is , people can make comparision . The new things would let people to rethink the way they do old things . They thought they do things pretty well , but actually they did not do it right . Therefore , successful people always try the new things in order to correct the mistake that they did not realize before .  In order to be successful , people should always not hestitate to try new things . They can therefore enhance their life both intensively and extensively .	CHI
The issue of specialization is difficult to deal with since plenty of different views have been expressed on this subject . On the one hand , one can be tempted to think that a great variety of knowledges allow somebody to enlarge his view of certain matters . However , we can not deny that a deeper knowledge in a specific subject can sometimes be required to solve some technical problems . Taking all aspects into account , I am strongly convinced that specialization does have more advantages than broad knowledge .  To begin with , specialization surely allows a better efficency in problem solving . Who would ask a mathematician to read Moliere while he can ask an actor ? As far as I am concerned , I am firmly convinced that each of us has one or several special skills , that make him different from the others : one plays the piano , his brother cooks well and I see no reason why the pianist should learn to cook ! On the contrary , he should continue learning piano to improve this particular skill .  Another way to justify my point of view is to consider it under the professional aspect . In relationship marketing , one makes the difference between the ` waiting time ' , which is the time the client waits before its problem is taken into account by a firm , and the ` solving time ' which is the time needed to solve this particular problem . By choosing specialists , the firm considerably reduces its ` solving time ' . Furthermore , the more different these specialists are , the shorter the ` waiting time ' will become , since a great variety of problems will be thus quickly taken into account .  Lastly , specialization may require from a firm to have a good internal organization . Indeed , without such an efficient organization , special skills of each employee may not be used as well as it should be . However , if a firm does settle down such an organization , and does prefer hiring specialized workers , its efficiency will surely improve .  To conclude , my strong belief is that specialization is a key answer to some persistent economical and political problems . A major stakes will thus be to accept the fact that one could not do everything perferctly . Afterall , Billy Wilder was probably right when he wrote that ` Nobody is perfect ' !	FRE
Will there be fewer cars in twenty years from now ? My instant reply is no , and mainly because I realize how our technology are rapidly advancing , and cars will change , changing only to make people love them more , satisfying urges for beautiful car models , creating more desires to own one . Looking back into the past since cars were first invented , there 's a huge big differences of how much cars are own . Compared to before when only the rich owns cars , cars nowadays are getting cheaper in price , considering the amount of second-hand cars being sold and how cheap it is to buy one . As time pass , the rich will continue to buy more cars and selling their old ones , and at the same time , the lower class will buy these used cars for a cheaper price . With this cycle going on , more and more people will be owning cars rather than selling them .  And why are the rich buying more and more cars ? Generally it 's because of the constant change in the car technology ; the desire of speed and unique designs . A stereotype view of rich people are people who buy cars just because of its looks . Car companies looking at this , will exploit this point by coming up with more and more uniquely designed cars . There 's a rare chance rich people will disappear and their interest in buying these cars decrease . On the other hand , there 'll always be the lower class people who are ready to buy these used cars at a lower price .  Most of the people wants to own a car , and in my opinion , this is a psychological desire ; jealousy . When a person sees another person with something they do not have , that person will also want a car . When a rich guy sees his friend with a really groovy car , he will also want a unique car of his own . There 're always more generations joining us and with this cycle of jealousy and how the car price falls , it 'll be easier for people to own cars . Conclusionally , I 'd say that in twenty years , or even fifty years , the amount of car usage will only increase but not decrease . Unless something better than cars join this market and successfully grab car buyers ' attentions .	CHI
I do agree that most advertismenets make products seem much better than they really are .  A possible explaination would be that these advertisements are based on different surveys made by professionals in order to know what the target public want to hear . For example , if a company wanted to sell a new skate board , it will interview teenagers who are skateboarding to know what they are looking for in a perfect product . They will do the same with the parents of the skateboarders because ther are the one who will pay for it . Once these informations are analyzed , a publicity will be made out of that . The content of this advertisement would be based on scientifcal data . The target public will see in the products exactly what they are looking for , it will appear as the perfect product . However , they might be disapointed once they have bought the item realizing that it is not that perfect .  An other way to illustrate my point is the advertisement for Kraft 's dinner products . This publicity targets whoever makes lunches at home , i.e. the mother and their kids . The product is sold as a healthy and convenient lunch . The kids look really happy to eat it and it seems really tastefull . However , one can easilly realize that Kraft 's dinner products are not a healthy meals and are not tastefull .  The publicity conceptors know that someone will be more likely to buy a product if it as a pretty presentation . That is the reason why all the products are in nice little boxes with bright colors and printed with impressive designs . An other way to make a product look attractive is by using the picture of a good looking women or a handsome men . Therefore , the client will purchase the item in order to be closer to the model on the box . But the product inside might not be that exceptionnal .  In conclusion , I think that advertisements company are able to identify the desires of customers and make a nice publicity featuring all them . They are able to show a way to people to reach their dreams . But dreams does not always come true . ..	FRE
I am agree with the thing than successful people try new things and take risks rather but there are not only doing what they already know how to do well because if they already know how to do well there do n't take any risks .  To be successful mean you will success on every thing you try but that mean you can try every thing and still success . Some one successful will want to try any thing for see if he still successful , if that person try only some things he know how to do well he is not a really successful person .  For example , I am good to play pianno so that pretty successful in a fist time but now i never play gitar and i try so I 'm not really good at the beginning but I take some lesson and really fater I get really good to play gitar , that mean I am a successul person . Now , I am a good dancer , I know how dance but i do not try any thing eals exepted dance so I am a good dancer but I am not a successful peron because the only thing where I success is the thing I already know .  Some one successful is so some one who try new things but he does not know if he will be good or bad and finally because he is successful he is going to be good to those new things .  For be really successfull you of course have to try lots of things than you can know how successful you are because to be successfull only for a couple things do not mean you are really successfull .  For exemple , After try to play gitar , I can now try a other instrument ant a other one . .. If I still success for every one , I am a really successful person .  So , if you really want to be a successful person you need try new thing and take risks rather . If you do not you just some one who look like successful but finally you are some one who is not successful .	FRE
I do n't agree that human beings will have a fewer cars in use than we have them today . There are two reasons that I think so .  One of the reasons is that more and more our popurations are increasing in it 's number because of the explosion of the population all over the world . This is to say , our popuraton is 6.0 billion right now , and it will increase up to 6.5 in twenty years or more than less . Therefore the car usage paesantage will increase in it 's number .  Other reasons is that our social attitude toward young people have changed . Comparing the past with now , the latter is much more leveral to young people . As long as 50 years ago , In many countries , the cars are driven by men , not woman but nowadays a lot of women drive a car because of the social change from conservative to leveral . The age that people are able to get the driver licence is difference country to country , and in certain country , young people who are 16 years old are able to get the driver licence With the social change , some of our countries might have such a law .  With the reasons , I do n't agree that , buteven though we have more cars in our future , the fuel will totally change , from oil to electricity or something like that .	JPN
It is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . If we look at the youth around us , we find them to be self occupied . They are busy with their own life .  The youngsters are living a life that is all about their own dreams , their own happiness and their own whims . Gadgets , friends , movies , discotheques , pubs and other such things are taking them away from their families and the community .  If they are not having fun , then , it is the increasing pressure of studies that keep them inside their homes after the school hours . Their studies and the stlye of the present school curriculum makes sure the the students are studying continuously .  The curriculum of most of the educational institutions is designed to give theoretical knowledge to the students . Lack of practicals takes away the chance of any external exposure from the student .  Apart from studies , the lack of interest in extending a helping hand for the matters related to the communities can also be observed amongst the youngsters . They are becoming a bit self-centred . For them its - ME FIRST . Everything else becomes secondary for them .  Another reason for their non participation can be traced to the fact that they do not understand the importance of joint familes and thus the concept of loving and sharing is a little alien to them . Earlier , the joint familes kept the people together . They were more tolerant , more caring and had better understanding of the importance of community . But , the concept of nuclear family has taken away the element of ` together we stand ' away from the youth .  Last month , the Mumbai blast rocked the whole nation and questioned our unity and security both . The terrorirsts involved were young boys . And if we look at the people who had come to help the victims then we find out that they were not the youth but the middle aged or old people .  It is not that all the youngsters are unhelpful but yes the majority is far too self centred to come out and give time to their community , to think of its well being . Apart from this , their modern values , their distance from religion , their shyness , etc are also playing a role in their behaviour .  At times , the thought that what can a single man do keeps them away from helping others . They need to understand that they have the power to dream and change the world . They just have to take a step forward .  It is high time that they realise that the community needs them as much as they need the community . Their survival and development is dependent on the community of which they are a part . Their involvement will do lots of good to them and to their community as well .	HIN
It has been an argument regarding with the issue that , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Some people prefer to travel alone . Because they do n't need to adjust their time for the other people and they can decide everything by themselves . However , on my perspective , I think it is better to travel by a group led by a tour guide rather than traveling alone .  First , If we travel to the place that we are not familiare , everything is so srange . So in this case we need somewone who are well known about the place , like a tour guide . It is certain that tour guide is an expert of the travel place , He or she will make a great scedule and adjust the time . The only thing that we have to do is following the schedule . I think It is convinient and we do n't need to waste the time .  Second , we can have more great experience with the group of people . People can exchange theire own opinion and also they can take a remarkable picture together . They can also enjoy more pleasure time rather than feeling alon . As people are living the social sociaty , travelling by a group could help to develope theire relationship  Finally , because of two reason , I think better and efficient way to travel is tarvelling in a group of people together led by a tour guide .

I am in according with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . The reason way I am in accord it is that I suppose that successful people are vocated to make better in any way they operate , and they want everytime a new target , much difficult from the past , to obtain . For this reason they try new things and sometimes they take risks but this give them the sensation of the power and the potential they have .  The normal people see them and consider that in the same situation or position they did n't take risks fairly like the successful people do . Infact normal people many times , consider successful people too much out of world for the reason that I mention at last .  Contrary to the normal people thinking I consider ordinary that successful people goes in another way from normal people because , if it is not true , they can be successful people .  The success of a person it is give first of all by nature because a successful people , before he had success , he was born with particular ability in specking , playing in general and to made better wath he had to do , respect the other people . With the growth up of the person the success coming to the people that had this particular ability sice they was young and for this reason they became `` effective '' successful people .  The society in general consider that take risks is the better way to falliment or the die . I support a different position , and this is that if a man did n't takes many risks in his life continue to be the little ordinary man that he is . But if a man takes many risks ( not everytime , but sometimes ) it is a sign of that he could be a successful people .  The successful people have to his part the luky , infact sometimes he made an activity with much more success than a normal people could obtaining . This is a particularity but it is n't want by people : it is a supernatural want .	ITA
I disagree that statement . I have three reasons why I have opposite point of view .  First , I think that continuing one thing for a long time is capable to make the man success . For example docotor has looked for more effective cure for his patient to get rid of his patient ' s suffer . He have to think risk and return . He should not take high risk and high return , high risk and low return and low risk and low return . He have to take high return and low risk . If the docter tends to take risks , what happened at the end ? Scond , I think that it is more important to concern about old things . trying new things is the mean to throw away old things . But old things that you had thrown away long long ago may bring you great chance . that is possible story , is n't that ? Third obeying that statement has the possibility of losing the tradition . So we should look the old things and low risk facters more intensively . That may make us succ	JPN
I totally disagree with the statement , even though oneself may believe that it is true to a certain extent because of the fact that young people love to play and no certain entity holds them responsible for their actions and the consequences of their actions . The following are the reasons and examples that explain why I strongly disagree with the statement mentioned in the question .  Firstly , if we examine some of the extracurricular programs offered at elementary and high schools around the world , we will find that many of these programs are devoted to helping local communities . These programs include activities such as ; cleaning side roads , collecting charitable donations and different socially responsible endeavours . Based on a research conducted by a leading consulting firm in Europe , it was shown that 5 % of a young person 's time is being dedicated to assisting their local communities .  Secondly , social responsibility and helping communities is becoming a very hot topic in the corporate world . This phenominon has extended its effect to outside of the corporate world to invlove the rest of the society . Therefore , many people are becoming more aware of the importance of being socially responsible , hence , they are starting to convey the benefits of being socially responsible to younger people ( i.e. their kids , students , dependents . .. etc . ) .  Finally , many young people groups are being used as great examples of time dedication in helping communities . Not only their communities , but also international communities . For example , a group of kids from France have gathered their toys and other belongings and sent them to Lebanon to help the kids who have left their homes because of the current Israeli-Lebanese war .	ARA
Nowadays , do you think young people give enough time to help their communities ? I can surely answer you , NO ! But why ?  In my view , I think the young people spend all their time together with the computer , games , KARAOKE , something like that .  I remember that when I was young , there have n't got any Gameboy , Playstation , Computer , my only entertament when I finished my homework is to see the television , swimming , running or play the basketball with my dad , very seldomly my faher will bring me to my cusion 's home to play the TV-Games . But now , the only after school function of the young people is sit in front of the computer and chat with their friends , or somehow play the online games . Because there are too many funny things on the internet . Then how can they get extre time to help their communities ?	CHI
I disagree to the statements that successfil people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  Firstly , in order to success , the analyzing the data and control the racio of wining is important . Now I am working at Bank as a foreign exchange trader , even professional , made the decision and scale the timing using the analyze of reading the charts , checking the orders and researching the economic data . Because foreign exchange market is unpredictable . I think it is the same thing apply to this theory . In general , unpredictable things often occers , sometime , people who has good luck might be survive from the happening but I strongly think those luck is not continue without their well background knowledge nor experience . Just trying new things without knowledge is just a risky .  Secondly , when I play tennis match . In those situation , I do not try new style of serve when I really want to win . Because the racio of I miss is very high .  Thats why I strongly believe that people who are succeed in the world are based on their knowledge and their experience .	JPN
In my personal opinion young people do not spend enough time helping their communities when it is needed . Our personal goals focus on ourselves whereas others generation 's goals focused on community . there may be many reasons why this change came upon us , however , I guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life . Our way of life push us to worry about personal things rather than global ones . We care about our personal image , our personal grants and our personal skills . We have to . However we must try to change and we ought to realize what it is happening outside and in fact we should give our helping hand . Anyway , I think young people are no blame of this kind of selfishness but they are unaware .  First of all , we have adquire a new way of life . We do live comfortable . Our parents usually provide us everything we need . Everywhere it seems as if nobody needs anything from us as long . Our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position as long as this person works . Thus , our goal is not related to our community in which everything runs `` perfectly well '' but it is focused in ourselves . Our own complains and artificial needs are highlighted . We have to be perfect not just good , but perfect . We have to worry about such things in order to survived in this `` ideal community '' .  Inasmuch as we are so worried about ourselves we are not able to see the problems our community has , we are not aware of that .  Regarding this lack of awareness we can explain why we do not help but we can not avoid trying people realize their selfishness . We have to take a look over our reality . We must do more for our community than we are doing up to now . It is a good chance not only for the community but for us to grow	SPA
It is commonly assumed that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Althought it might not be exact for every advertisements , this gap between reality and representation is experienced on a daily basis .  First , we have to keep in mind the primary goal of an advertisement , which is to attract customers to a specific product . Hence , advertisement makers have to rely on commercial technics that give the impression that their product is not only good , but that it is better than other products of the same category .  It is precisely in this process that a gap may occure between what the product really is , and how it is presented to the customers . Even if we assume that the advertisement makers are aware of the basic qualities of a product , what is to be understood is that their goal is to make you think that you need this particular product , hence emphasizing it 's qualities and of course passing under silence it 's negative aspects . This unbalanced and biased view on the product inherent value will surely produce a distorted perception of it 's real desirability , making it seem much better than it really is .  The car industry provides numerous examples of this phenomenon . This very competitive market forces advertisement makers to present every car as they are perfectly fitted for you , which is not always the case . For example , american car makers have the tendency to promote their vehicule by stating their durability and their power . But they naturally never mention the fact that these vehicules are much more energy-consuming than non-american cars . Hence , if one relies only on the advertisement , he will be conviced that this particular american automobile is a really good product . But , if he buys it , he will soon realize that his vehicule has a high gas consumption rate . He then might have the feeling that he made the wrong choice , that the vehicule was not as good for him as the advertisement pretented . This illustration shows clearly that advertisements are by definition enhancing the apparent value of a product in order to sell it .	FRE
As an old saying goes , `` One man 's meat is another man 's poison . '' People 's opinion diverge from each other , not to mention on such statement : `` Travel by ourselves and travel in a group led by a tour guide , which one is better ? '' Some people prefer the fomer , but , i disgree . I prefer to travel in a group led by a guide because it really has a number of benifits that we can not deny .  The first reason for my inclination is that traveling in a group led by a tour guide can give me a more pround knowledge of my travel . No one could detail the history of a new spot only by your touring guide book . No one could speak out where is a more valuable spot located only by your telphone . No one could know more senaries by only confine yourself on the maps . However , the tour guide can !  The second for my pepensity is that travelling in a group led by a tour guide can make you a connection to different kinds of people . I just took part in a travel in a group led by a tour guide , and i made friends which involved in it and what't more , until now i still keep in touch with one of them who is aslo a university student like me . And she is in the same major as me , so it is a luck for me to have this kind of tour and get so good a friend who has the same personal experience and emotional concern as me !  Last but not least , travelling in a group led by a tour guide can make you safer and happier . If you visit by your self , who will help you when you get hurt ? If you visit by yourself , who will help you to go on your tour when you lose your way ? If you visit by yourself , who will talk with you when you feel faint during your bus way ? Nobody . And this is quiet different from travel in a group where you can ask your tour guide and talk with other travelers .  All in all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is an advisable choice with conspicuous benifits . I prefer to it fully . Now , what i want to do is to make sure that every one around me who likes travelling as much as me can reach all these benifits .	CHI
Travel around the world is a great activity , there are so much to admire and learn . People can travel for pleasure to exotic places like : Hawai or Bermuda or can travel looking for culture , like : Egypt or Japan . Usually couples go this places looking for relax .  If people travel for pleasure does not need a tour guide , because usually for this kind of travel , travel agencies offer packages with all the activities . This activities are for relax and fun . You do not need a guide for that . However , if you are planning to go Egypt for example , you will need a tour guide .  A tour guide is a person who knows about the area and most important knows about history . When people travel `` time '' is very important , so you need to see and learn as much as you can is less time . Therefore , a tour guide is the right person to acomplish this goal .  A tour guide not only knows about history and important places , but also good restaurants , places to have fun and places to avoid because of the security .  I remember when I went to Mexico , my friends and I went to visit some ruins and we hired a tour guide . While we were on the bus going to this City `` El Carmen '' the tour guide star explaining and taking about this ruins , by the time we got there we knew what to expect .  I will like to go in the future to Egypt with a group of friends and we will definitly be led by a tour guide . There is so much to see in Egypt that I do not want to waste time looking for places or get lost , when we can hire somebody that can take us directly to the best places .	SPA
You often hear that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I also agree with this statement . There are several reasons why I think so .  The first is that the costs to drive and possess a car would be much higher than today . Because the price oil would get higher . Also today you can see this , because in the last years the price for oil is exploded . And also the taxes for cars would raise because the government cares about the environment and needs money . So not every person will have the money to use a car .  Another reason why cars will be get fewer is that there will be a lot of other options to come from point A to point B in the future . For example a transrapid will be built in munich in the next years . So many people would not use a car if they have the possibilty to go by the transrapid . And today many people research for new ways of transport people that are not as bad for the environment as cars are .  A third reason is , that more and more people move into the big citys to get a job . So there will be more people in the bigger cities of the country . And in big citys you normally do n't need a car . I think so because with the car you need su longer than if you user other possibilitys because there a many traffic jams in bigger citys . For example a friend of me studies in munich and he needs with his car one hour to come from his home to the university . With the bike or the subway he only needs half an hour . So I think many people will then use a bike or go by subway .  For conclusion you can say , that there are a lot of good reasons why in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .	GER
Do youing people enjoy more than older epole , that is a very diffivult question , taking in accoubt that most peole would think that young people might have more fun than older peole , just because they think that they are healthier , faster , stronger , as my mom used to tell me , teenagers think they are suoperman , they take risks that older peole normally wouldnt takem , thety stay up all nioght , go to parties , drive fast carsm , and maybe even do illegal drugs , but that does not mean that young people has more fun , i once read a very good book `` Tuesdays with Morrie '' . its a book about life , it shows the experiences of a young man , interacting with an elder , the elder has gone through various experiences , and the youngster wants to learn from thoe sxperiences , and eventually , the teacher tells him one thing , `` you first need to learn how to die , thenm you can learn how to live ... '' that tells the student that he has to absorb all that he canm from his experiences , and then let go of some of his emotions and then , he can know how it feels to taste succes , or love , and even pride . Morrie , who is the teacher on the book tells the main caharcter that once you know how if feels how to die , yopu know how to live because you learn how to enjoy life even more . the point i am trying to make is that older people know how to take more and more from each new experience , and they probably enjoy life even more , although there are a few exceptions , some young people are evry mature and find a way to have fun even in the worst cituatuions , like people that dont have as many economic resources , they learn how to take advantage from the few oportunities they have to go out , or party as we say nowadays . i honestly think that older people have mopre fun , because they have learned how to enjoy life , and young people are just living at a hundred miles an hour , trying to do too many things to have fun , and not getting a lot out of the experinces that they6 go through in their daily lifes .

I agree with the statement that products seem to be much better than they really are , because of the advertisement which is used . The marketing department of every company tries to make successful advertisement , so that they sell more of these products . Their aim is to influence the consumers to buy the articles or products .  Because of this , they are using different things for different products to catch the potential user : The marketing department uses kids and a happy family to make an advertisement for an family car , so that the husband of the family hopefully thinks : `` That 's the perfect car for our family . I will buy this one next week . ''  You can see advertisement like this everywhere : During the breaks in a movie or between TV-Shows there are always spots with the aim to buy the product .  Another example for that could be an advertisement for washing machines : `` It 's the cheapest washing machine of the world , you will save a lot of money buying this one ! '' But on the other side it is probably not an economies product , so that the consumer have to pay a lot for water and electricity , because of the bad technology .  The managers try with this strategy that the article looks like the best . They want to sell more than the other companies .  That 's why the consumers need to decide by their one which product is the best for them . The best way to realize it , is not listen or watch to too much advertisement . In the most ways it is better look behind the advertisement , that means you need to look what can i realy do with it .  The consumers need to make a comparison between some products - which one has the best properties or is the most economiesly and not which one looks like the best in the advertisement .	GER
often happen that we can hear elderlies complain about their conditions , such as '' ohh my god , I am too much old , I don `` t do anything , I am tired . .. '' . Instead usually youg people enjoy to be on youthhood , to be active , to go around . I think this fact is displayed in any family that has got a grandmother or an elderly in general and some child . If is true that maybe we are get used to hear this king of thing I think that the real situation is different .  First I think that when old people talk about their healt conditions is only another way to tell `` hello I am here '' . After probably they certain don `` t fell so bad to involve that they fell sick . When you are old maybe can happen to be alone for long time , have got too much time to think . As a result you start to consider too much your feeling . Image if you start to think that your foot hurt you , probably after one day you will be really hurted from that . Why ? And if is only because the power of our mind sometime overcome our own sight . I don-t know if is true but often I thought to be sick and at the end it wasn-t anything . So can be .  Second what can you talk to someone that come to meet you if you during the day was setting spending your time lookink the street , nothing I think . But now talk about the young . In my opinion is really bad listen some young guy that complains about his or hers age , probably he do be really sick , in his or hers mind . It is rare but sometime happen to listen these gender of people that spend their time continuosly claiming to be sick . You are not ! you have got the common problem that a guy can meet during his or hers age of growth . You are raising .  By the end I think that every age has got a good reasos to be live . When you are old because you childhood , when you are young because you are full of energy , the world seems under your feet , that wait only you . So probably the best thing that we can do is think by ourself , our result and what will happen tomorrow . The life is so a guess that we mustn-t be bored because sometime this don-t go where we want . Life is life and age as well .	ITA
I fully agree with the statement that succesful people try new things and take risks . In our everyday life , we have many examples that confirm this opinion , but the most important one is given by our interpreneurs .  Interpreneurs are always risking a lot in terms of money and time . Moreover , enterpreneurs are always innovating , trying new things in order to survive in the market , to be competitive , to improve their position on the global market . The main result of this behaviour is the success that everybody can recognize as tipical of enterpreneurs .  On the other side , we have the low level employes . They only do what they have been teached to do at the beginning of their carreer and they do this work for all the life . Very often , this kind of people are really very good in doing some specific work and they usually work for all their life for the same Company . Generally , they never take any risk and the company fully protect and support them because they have a very strong know how . But if we analyse the lifes of these people we can see that they never achieve any success .  To conclude , I think that to be succesful in the life , we need to take risks and try new things . Moreover , in this way we can keep alive our mind , we can train our creativity , we can better express ourself as human being . I think that we need to live as deep as possible our unique life , therefore we musttry as much as possible new things !	ITA
One could wonder if , in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I personally think , that because of a lot of factors we will explore , this statement is not ag On my way to this test this morning I was able to read a copy of the ` Le Monde ' newspaper . Inside it , an article stated that the State of California has decided to cut down on CO2 gas emissions by taking car manifacturers to court . The reason I mention this article , is that it stated that there are about 36 million cars in California for about 35 million housholds . In my opinion California is one of the best example of a region in which the use of the car is essential in order to be able to move around its vast territory . But California is also the most prosperous of all american states and therefore can demonstate to us the type of situation that could arise if a country developped to such a scale and therefore had this type of need for cars . It has become common knowlege , or fear , or indeed both for many people , that in twenty years , China will be a lot more prosperous that it is today . If we just considered the fact that its GDP grows of 7 % a year , we could say that by 2026 , China would have equaled California 's prosperity . What makes me tend to refute the proposed statement , is the fact that China has a population of about 1 billion , this would probably equate to about 400 million households and therefore potentially about 350 million cars needed by a new prosperous population to wonder through their vast country and cities . I am of course not stating that China is a car free environement at the moment but the increase with the volume of car the country experiences today would be monumental .  Furthermore , one would have to consider other growning economies such as India . Europe is saturated with cars and efforts are made in order to diminish pollution by increasing alternative means of transport . But this is possible because the territories are relatively small in comparison to immensities such as India or China .  One could also say that , as demographics are increasing , there will always be more people on earth , until we finally destroy it , and therefore more potential car drivers and buyers as a whole .  It must also be pointed out that , since the apparition of the Ford T model in the 1920s , the first affordable and mass produced car , the car has become an object that simbolizes liberty . No indication seem to show that , in a near future , men will invente a new symbol and vector of liberty to replace the car . If they do , the psychological aspect gone , and only the practical aspect of owning and driving a car remaining , we might witness an increase in alternative transportations methods and therefore car usage would slowlz decrease . However , it is very ulikely that this will happen during the next twenty years , and even if it did , that twenty years will be enough to witness a drop in car usage . A change of peoples ' psychology takes time .  Finally , one has to point out that the arguement that petrol will not be available in a couple of decades is not valid . Firstly , this theory has been enounced many times and new petrol reserves are being found day after day . Secondly , new energy supplies are being developped , such as the biometric fuel or the eletric car .  The car may be cleaner and even potentially out of date in twenty years , but , as far as the proposed statement is concerned , there will not be fewer of them on a global scale , as long as there will be more humans and more economic groath on this planet .

Recently , some psycologyst proclaimed that prefering the old things make people ca n't get success . Like their opinion i believe the courage to new one is neccesiary to be the successful people . Because the person who try new things has more sence about their field an , more responsibility and more real affection . Firstly , the people who try to do new things have great sence about their fields . The rationale behind this is that they struggle to prove whether therir theory is right . In this situation , the exact knowledge is needed to them . It makes they study more hardly about that .  For example , my brother 's major is science but he did n't interest about that . Last semmester , His proffesior gave him homework to make new product . Afeter this he was concentrating on his work . Even meal time he did n't put off his book .  Like above , the tring which find new ways makes people more concentrate to their field . Secondly , the tring to new things make them more responsibility . Genarally to proclaim some new things is related with their credit . because if it is proved wrong , then they will loose their trusty . I gave some new advise to my cousin and after that i have try to do that way by my self . It makes me have more responsibility . Lastry finding new ways about their field makes some	KOR
I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . It is true that learning fact is important but not importan than ideas and concepts .  As my experience , most of the professor gives test based on the ideas and concepts of the what we learned . purpose of testing is the how much students gets ideas and concepts of the content and how to apply it . None of my professor wanted the students to get pass the class without understanding ideas and concepts .  According to Korean Newspaper , most succeceful students are getting ideas and concepts of the subject , not the facts . Reseachers tested experiment in one high school . They had fifty people were studied only concepts and ideas , and fifty student were studied only facts . The result of the experiment was forty out of fifty students who were in the idea and concepts group got A 's and ten out of fifty students who were in the facts group got A 's in the test .  After reading this researchers paper i focus on the understanding ideas and concepts of the contents . As a result my grades were higher than studying facts . I think understand ideas and concepts is more important that learning a facts . Just getting a good grade is not the good point for the student . Student have to understand ideas and concepts and walk one step forward to the feature .	KOR
I have two opinions in the understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts by student as mention in the follow .  I agree with this opinion for several causes . The under standing idea and concept has important role in understanding subject and get the the higher degree in exams . Usually this ideas and concept derive from exprimental of the scientists before converted into the facts . Most of the theoritical sceience and also practical sceince based upon ideas and concepts . The origin of most innovations in the world was concepts or ideas .  Also I agree with student must be learn facts which is merely true in opposite to ideas and concepts which may be true of false .  Finally , I suggest for educational members and socities to learn both ideas and concept which are true and may be profitable for the society in accompany with facts which are approved by scientist and their experimentals .

It 's the `` eternal strife '' between the seller and the customer .  As we walk through the streets of a city today and just look around , if we just give a glance to a newspaper or a magazine , if we turn on the TV for a few seconds , what we see is that we live in a culture made for a great part of advertisements .  What they are is easy to define : short , colourful , attracting and effective ( or suppose to be so ) messages , calling our attenction to product of the most various sort . What 's behind their glittering surfaces ? That 's the question that amazes and sometimes confuses the customer and that he goes on wondering for some time . Unfortunately , the answer is that often what we find is not what we expected to handle and we have to conclude that teh single product is not such a good staff as it was supposed to be .  For example , some years ago a famous industry had for some time its car advertised by a short movie , in which the car was running on the waters around Mount S. Michel , France . It was really impressive , but as the car came out in the market , it revealed to be inferior to the standard of the house .  A field especially affected by misleading advertisement is that of food stuff : deli presented as prodigious or incredibly tasty have often not safe origin , or not good taste . The reason that hides behind all of that , you can easily track out : marketing is one of the finest and most expensive business of our time . Marketing is going to look more and more like an art , whose task is not to inform the customer about real qualities of the product , but to make the best of it , to describe it in the most imaginative and intriguing way .  It 's also important to remember that a great amount of money is invested in trade by single or group sellers and the effort to have effective advertisements is normally equal to the productive effort .  As it happens normally in human life , is possible to find a glance of good just adopting the right perspective : about advertisement , maybe ther will be a time when we should not ask if they are relieble or not , if they tell us the truth or an amount of lies . Just look or listen to the stories and enjoy the glittering tale !	ITA
It is debatable whether young people do not help their communities not spending enough time . Some people say that young people provide enough time to helping their communities in that they are doing some voluntary works for communities . However , I agrees with the statement in that young people tend to spend more time studying and they do n't have the sense of belonging to their communities .  To begin with , nowadays students do not help their communities enough time . This is because they think that their grades are more important than helping communities . Therefore they are spending more time studying for their good grades than doing volunteer works . For example , my brother is a high school student . When he were asked to work for his community from his school , he got angry . That 's because he think helping his community is a waste of time and also does n't help improve his grade .  In addition , because young people do n't have the sense of beloning to their local communities , they are not willing to help their community a lot of time . Young people think they can move other places whenever they want to move . Therefore they do not feel the necessarity to provide aid to their local communities , sacrifying their own time . For instance , according to KBS , Korea national broadcast station , 70 % of young people they do not have to help their local society . When they were asked reasons , they answered that they did not have the sense of belonging to their communities .  In conclusion , enough time for young people to helping local communities do not meet needs of communites . This is because young people invest their time on studying for good grades . Also they do not feel the sense of the belonging to their communities . This phenomenon must not be underestimated in the aspect that young people will be a person who leads the local communities .

The demand of mobility and access is not likely to cease for modern life , however the supply which will enable people to mobilize will certainly shift from conventional methods established today . With this fact , one can go further and argue that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars than there are now . Such argument can be coherent in itself if one is to see changing trends in mobility regarding alternatives and enviromental issues .  When it comes to compare cars with their alternatives such as planes , trains and ferries they all seem to be better than cars on some certain aspects stated below . For instance it is a known fact that the average use of cars is around 1 , 5 people per car worldwide which proves how inefficient cars are compared to massive transportation ways such as trains , ships and planes . In addition to this cars aslo create a trafic problem which is uncomparable to its alternatives . Despite cars seem like providing more accesibility than their alternatives since one can drive whereever he wants and whenever , this fact also seems like it is changing . It may be the case that , twenty years from now , planes and trains will develop to an extend that they will be cheaper to use and more frequent in destination . At this point it should also be remembered that cars have considerable upkeep costs due to repairs and taxes which will eventually became a luxury compared to its alternatives .  Apart from loosing its chance among its alternatives cars will most likely be forced to reduce in number due to their harmful affects on the enviroment . The fundamental need of a car to run is oil and this fact is unlikely to change in coming twenty years . Regarding increasing concerns on the global warming this need of cars will make it likely to be replaced . In addition to harmful gasses released cars also damage enviromet by creating sound pollution and indirectly by drivers demanding more roads . The more cars there will be the more roads and sound pollution there will be as well . Subsequently these will make people take a decision between altering their mobility styles or facing results of enviroamental disorder .  In conclusion , it seems that because of the drives mentioned here and many possible others that extend the limit of this esasy , cars are going to be replaced realtively by its alternatives . Maybe these drives will let car industries to develop new cheap and enviroment friendly solutions but even this isnt likely to stop a change in choices . It is because that maybe other industries will take the advantage of their increasing usage and will develop futher technologies which will make them uncomperable to cars .	TUR
I think that this statement can summarize an important problem of the actual society . In my opinion we live in the society of appearance , where exterior aspects sometimes have considered more than the substances of the things ! I think that it is evident in one million of situations . Let 's think for instance at our markets , they are full of colored boxes and bottles and I am sure that everyone of us , at least one time in the own life , has bought a kind of food or beverage just for how well it was showed on the box that contained it !  We can think also at the spots on tv , that everyday introduce to us so many kind of , I call them usefull things , that seems to be the new and perfect solutions at a lot of our problems ( and the most of the time they solve just one `` problem '' : how to spend our money ! )  Another example comes from the fashion world , it is a little bit different from the previous ones , but I think that in a different key it can reflect the same problem .  How many times we have seen some perfectly slim models that seemed to be healty and , of course , satisfacted by their own bodies ? And how many times we have heard ( some time later ) that they had a lot of problems with anorexy , their everyday lunch was a carrot and their lifes were unhappy ?  It has happened a lot of times I guess . .. Now the point is that the society presents to us some patterns that are almost never real , or better it shows to us , thanks to some advertisements or something else , what it does want to show to us , but not all the truth !  I think that it is not easy today to not be impressed by the external side of the things that are around us but , I think also that to not going into a lot of delusions in our life we should start to look behind the appearance of the things that are presented to us to understand what they really are !

I do agree with the fact that successful people have challenging careers that conducts them to have risky positions .  A successful person may be qualified in that way because he or she has been distinguished from other people who has not faced the same success . And someone has of course many more opportunities to be distinguished in a challenging and difficult environment than is an simple one . Actually in that last kind of environment , a lot of people may fullfill the duties in a cogent way and we generally expect them to do so , consequently it is a normal situation that does not lead to any particular kind of success . At the opposite , by having a challenging carrer someone may face many quandaries and diverse kind of problems . The exposition is bigger . By being in risky positions , people are not expected to success every time , they may fail but when they manage to solve a problem or develop a difficult or new business , then they are distinguished and become successful people .  Another important point is that being in a challenging environment and taking risks allow people to break the everyday life routine . Actually , by facing new and difficult situations , people do not have time to get borred . Their motivation can be very huge considerating the stakes . By following that idea we can assume that people may fullfull their duties with more enthusiasm that in less risky positions . Actually , we can easily get bored by doing something we know well so we could give less importance for our job and replace it with other things which is not at all to be unerconsiderated . People may have different priorities or qualities in life that are not suited to a complex environment .  For these reasons I do agree with the statement , and my opinion can be easily verified with successfull people such as politics or businessmen who faced difficult positions .	FRE
I disagree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling on our own . From personal experieces , I 've learned that touring on our own gives more oppurtunity to be more knowlegable about the place we 're traveling , more time to travel unknown places , and more chances to communicate with locals .  As a personal example when I went to Cambodia last winter , I went with a tour group led by a guide . Before I went I knew I had to study about the places I would go , but I postponed such duties because I was expecting the guide to explain everything . Just as I expected , when I went to ancient sites in Cambodia the tour guide explained every little detail , leaving no space for me to further find out . However , when I went to Europe by myself this winter , I felt obliged to study about the background information or about the European history because there was no guide to answer my questions . The fact that I was planning all the journey on my own gave me more resposibility to study about the place I would go to .  Such cases are not merely limited to my personal examples . Also when we travel with a group led by a guide , we have to follow with the tuor company 's tight schedule . Out itinery is often scheduled and we merely follow where the guide takes us . We do n't have much free time to ramble around new places other than the famous tour cites . However , when we 're on ourselves we do n't have to move accordingly to a fit schedule . We are free to go anywhere we 'd like . Other than famous tour cites , we could simply go to local markets or take a walk down the streets -- places that are ordinary but also places where we can smell the local 's custom and culture .  Furthermore , when we 're traveling with a guide we 're too busy following the tight schedules to acutally communicate with the locals . Touring with a guide often ends with visiting famous cites and taking pictures . But when traveling on your own , we have more chances to actually be friends with the locals . Although there might be some language barrier , we can use body language and talk with locals about their life-style , custom , and culture . Traveling on a group led by a guide lacks the precious moment to learn about a country in a first-hand experience .  Traveling in a group led by a tour guide surely does have some benefits . We do n't have to plan all our schedules , and we do n't need to worry about not knowing something because the guide is there for you to explain everything . However , so far from all my journeys , the most memorable and long lasting experiences were those that I traveled by myself . Starting from scheduling my itinerary , studying about the country , exploring new places , and meeting people from walks of street is truly the valuable and the real journey I never forget .	KOR
I completely aggree with the statement . Success is attained by forcing yourself to the limits , out of your confort zone , and conquering the challenge , whatever it may be . Through preparation and acumen , and utilizing what you have learned in your past experiences , stepping out of the confort zone and facing a challege directly , is the best way to increase stamina and tolerance that will help make you become stronger .  For example , being a martial art student and observing the successful moves of my mentor and chief instructor , I can confidently state that he practices for success . I met my instructor when he was merely a senior student , once he became the chief instructor and owner of the school , he revolutionized the curriculum to do things that had not been done before-this is getting out of your confort zone , knowing that you are doing well , but that you know you are capable of further success . The chief instructor decided to expand the curriculum and incorporate social activities that will benefit the people in the community . In order to do this he was forced to expand his staff on contract - this means that he committed to employ this staff for at least a year - , regardless of the outcome from the changes in the curriculum . To make the story short , the exposure to community activity increased the popularity of our school , and the respect , reputation , and profits that came along with . It would have been financially challenging for the school to have staff that would have not been needed , had the social activities addtion to the curriculom not succeeded-he would have thought of something though . The chief instructor was looking to be more successful through innovation and thinking out of the box , and in my opinion , he attained his goal .  Another example , and a more common one , is the introduction of Microsoft Windows as an operating system in 1990 's . Before , Windows came all about , most operating systems were based on prompt and response and peole were used to it . Systems like DOS and Lunix that were monotonous , but worked well . Mr. Gates took a tremendous risk in creating a whole new interface to use in the computer , an interface that was more expensive and complex , but turned out to be more effective and entertaining for most users . Nowadays , Windows is the most popular operating system . Taking risks means thinking out of the box , moreover , it takes courage and confidence , to materialize the idea . Mr. Gates , thought Windows would work , took steps to attain his goal , and succeeded .  In conclusion , trying new things , while risky , can improve the individual and the outcome through challenging out endurance and tolerance . No one says it will be easy , but if you are persistent enough , you will eventually succeed .	SPA
In today 's world , people should know everthing for a better life . For instance a manager have to know advertising and also has knowledge of account in order to be an effective one .  As far as I 'm concerned , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . There are many advantages and disadvantages of having broad knowledge of many subjects . However , I want to explain its advantages because it is more heavier than other .  First of all , knowledge does not make a damage to brain . It is always usefull for example I am a math teacher nonetheless , I have many hobbies like painting . I went courses on this topic drawing or colors . My friend meets me to an exebition a result of this this knowledge about painting gets me an advantage such as having entellectual knowledge .  Secondly , life is so complex and full of tasks as a result of this , every time in our life we need kinds of knowledge . Consequently , it makes our life easier . I want to explain this with an example . For instance , I am a student and in my daily life I do n't need the knowledge of economy suh as interest rates but on the other hand when I want to be a cashier in a bank , the manager of the bank ask me while I apply for the job that do you know what the interest rate and how it is counted and how it changes the amount of money . Thus , I have no cahnce , I have to know that if I want this job . Consequently , it makes my life easier such as so as to attend a job for earning money .  Most important of all , people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are always acheivers . For instance , I read Einstein 's life one week ago and understood that Einstein was one of these kinds of people . He had wide range of knowledge about everthing such as science and also maths . This knowledge made him in order to establish new scientifical research .  All in all , having knowledge of many subjects make our life easier and also make us happier at the same time making succesfull .	TUR
That is a very difficult question ! But me personally , I disagree . I think as older you get as more you will enjoy the life . It has something to do with the life experiance , the money or the income , the knowledge . .. That should n't mean , that young people do not enjoy their life . But I think , they enjoy it in a different way ! And that 's the fun part in your younger age . When you are young , you normally do n't know that much about life , so you have to adventure it . Normally with no or with much less money as you will earn when you 're geting older .  And that means , that you can concentrate more on the real things you are interested in in life . As an example : When you are young and you want to go on vacation you 're looking for a cheap way of doing it . .. Maybe a very cheap flight to Mallorca/Spain , a youth Hostel for 10 bucks per day . No breakfast , coz you still have enough alcohol in your stomach , from the night before . ..  I am 30 now . And this kind of vacation would be way to hard for me know . But when I think back . .. 5-10 years ago I would have loved it .  Now I would rather flz somewhere very nice , with a nice Hotel , maybe a rental car . Some sightseeing . And in the evening I would go out for dinner . To a nice Restaurant , with some delicious food and a nice wine !!!!  So for me . .. I enjoy my life more when I 'm getting older !	GER
Schools that teach k-12 students require students to study various subjects . These subjects that the students learn are not necessarly useful in their carrier . I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .  If it is better to master in one specific subject , why do the schools teach numerous subjects to the students ? A student might agree that the subjects that they are learning in school is useless and meaningless to learn . This is not true because as you grow more mature you will realize that the thing you learned in school really comes to help in the real life . So it is better to study and have knowledge on various types of subjects rather than having unlimited knowledge on one subject .  It may seem better to specialize in one specific subject when you get a specific job that require those knowledges you learned . Well , this is just in your carrier . When you get out to the social world , the things you learned are too professional that no one , but you and people who work with it understand . If you want to get involved in a social life and understand life better , it is better to know many things . For an example , when you go to a party where all kinds of different people gather . You want to talk to people , but you only know that specific topic and do not know other topics that people talk about . As a result , you will be secluded and feel alone .  In conclusion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . With broad , but many knowledge you will enjoy better life where you are not left behind , and you will be able to appreciate other people 's opinion more . On the other hand if you only know about a specific subject , you will be left alone and feel secluded . To lead a successful life , it is better to know alot of thing rather than a specific topic .

Advertisements are everywhere . On TV , in shopping malls and in the newspapers . And every brand and product seems to be the best in its category . But do the advertisors tell the truth or do they lie or exaggerate about their `` perfect '' products ? This is exactly what the given statement is about .  I agree with the statement , that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . For example : laundry detergents . Every brand claims to be the best product , to make your clothes look like new , to remove every single stain . They compete in comparing their products to each other . And their product is always better than the one of the concurrents . But in my belief this is not true . Some advertisements say , that they don `` t bleach your clothes , that they still look like new after 30 wash circles . But no detergent can hold this statement .  Another example is shampoo . If you would trust the advertisements , every shampoo can make your hair shiny , strong and even not greasy anymore . But this is so untrue . Shampoos often don `` t hold the consumer '' s expectations .  My last example are cigarettes . In advertisements cigarettes seem to make you feel free , that they make you happy when you are sad . They even make you feel like in another world . But is this really true ? Doesn `` t it have any disadvantages or even dangers ?  Of course it does ! Only a few years ago no cigarette advertisement said , that cigarettes affect your health and that they can cause cancer that sometimes ends in death . Today they warn their customers in advertisements and even on cigarette boxes , but it is usually written in a very little size and so often ignored or not seen by consumers . Some consumers take these warnings ironically .  In conclusion , you always have to be aware that advertisors try to sell their product to earn a lot of money . That `` s why they sometimes exaggerate or even lie what their products are able to do . The and if so , it makes You should be careful and you should buy different products to compare them to each other and to think about how they can harm yourself or others . Only then , you will find out which products are the best for you or which products you shouldn `` t even buy because of their harm .	GER
The development of science and technology have implied a permanent increase in products and market 's options in our times . The public need to know which products exist and which are thier caractheristics and quality . For this reason , the advertisments are playing an important rule giving us , the comsummers , the posibility to know about what we are going to buy . But the advertisments need to offert a good product for sales and then they can give to the people a false valoration of them .  The advertisements always are going to express a partial opinion about the product : the owner 's consideration . First , he needs to create the idea that you need it . Later , he will convincent the public that what he is offering is the best . In all cases , he will try to give you the best opinion . Even , without see the thing or taste it first by himself a person can think that this product is the wonderful and buy it . in addition , a product can not be very important for you , but if you see it in the commercials you can think to buy it and you can create a reason for this purchase . In many cases this product will remain in the garage or in some place of the house you can not remembar later .  The adverstisements are going to express every time acceptance and good opinion about the product because they pretend to catch the comsumer 's attention and make it enter in the market in a competitive way . When a new thing arrives to the market , it must show sufficient quality and presence to compite with the others products of the same kind that already exist and win costumers . For this reason many products only have a good presence and there are not as well as thay must , in account to the commercials .  I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and they lie to the public with bussiness porpouses . Costumers must be carefull of the purchases and try to warranty it too .	SPA
The technology keeps on changing day to day . In the next twenty years people might not be using as many cars as there are today . Although cars are the major means of transport today , by the increasing technology there might be a new vehicle that may be replacing the car today . Also the scarcity of the resources may urge us to less the car number .  Now a days many people are using the cars in all parts of the world . The more we use the cars in number there will be more demand for the resources for car fuel . By the next few years the fuel which we are using now for the car may be in scarcity . So the world will any have to abandon the use of the cars as they were running out of fuel . So people will certainly look for the other fuel vehicles . Thus the number of the cars used may be reduced in the next twenty years .  There is always been a new thing replacing the old one in this world . People are always hunger of hunting the new technology . As the cars are the faster transport media within the city and also comfortable means , people are using them in large number . If a new car with new technology and with better speed is brought in the market , people will rush to buy it . In fulfilling the requirements of the people there might be a new vechicle , which may be a small air craft , in the market that attracts the people . Then the people will obviously will keep the cars in the back . So the era of the cars may change with the introduction of the new transport vechicle leaving it to the back stores .  The advancements in the technology , the changing requirements of the people and the changing environment may some day , probably in the next twenty years , reduce the number of cars we are using now .

Not just because I am a lawyer I can neither agree nor disagree to this statement because it is far to general . A person who does not enjoy life as a young person will most likely also not enjoy life when he becomes older just because he has just never `` learned '' to enjoy life .  Even if you look a the question as a comparison of people at one defined time one ca n't evaluate which group of people enjoys life more than the other because it just depends on to many factor and age itself is rather an unimportant one of these .  Much more important are factors like , health , relativ wealth , and environment . However I believe the most important factor is personal attitude . Personal attitude is so important it can even outweight many or even all factors . Anybody would agree to this in general however very few try to benifit from this fact .  E.g. somebody who is healthy , rich and lives in a peradise among many friends but will is unhappy would look for a reason and maybe just come up with the fact that he is relatively old .  The other example would be a young , poor , sick , and lonely person . This person could still be happy and enjoy life and would not even think about the question why he would do that .  Whether you are young or old does not indicate anything about whether or not you enjoy life . I personally think that my life has improved a lot since I have grown up . I think I will never fight my age but work on myself to improve myself and my attitude and to enjoy the things that are really important in my life which are my two sons and my wife . If my family and I stay healthy than what else do I need ?	GER
Nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . i agree with that statements and i think that there are several reasons for that .  First , conditions of life has changed , everything is going faster now , people do not have much free time , they time is separated between their studies , their part time jobs , sport , and some social activities so after all this they do not have much time left to do something else .  Second , people now are no longer attached one to another as they used to be , its just like if they use the means of friendship and communication directly with others . so as a result , if they not communicate well they will not be able to help their communities as a group .  Finally , before in a neighbourhood eveybody knows everybody because there was not much people , but now its getting crowded and they may not know who is their second neighbour . so how would they meet and try to help their communities if they do not even know each other .  To sum up , i think that people should well organize their schedules and find some time to help their communities because after all that is where they live .	ARA
Yes I do agree with that young people nowadays do not giving enough time to helping communities . Bcause nowadays young people very much intersted in enjoyment and they don n't care what is happening in their community . what is a community ? . community is group of people living place with similar custooms , and helpling each other in need .  Even though if you are busy with your work , studies or somthing else as member of your community you need to help in the development of your community . But the present youth not helping thier community rather they are wasting thier time by spending time in internet cafe , watching movies , or romonig around the city . They could help thier community by doing some volunteer work .  Mainely the youth is getting distracted into unnessasory thing , like wasting tmie on browsing , chatting rubbish with somebody . What the youth thinking is enjoyment , for that they are drinking in the pubs . spending the whole evening in the pubs or roads . Rather they could do some thin in the evening or at any time when ever they are free , by participating in progarmmes which were planned for community development .  In addition they don n't luistening to their parent about thier involvement in development of their community .  On the whole , I can conclude one main thing is that as a part of your community youth should help their community by spending soome daily you could do some thing which ids usel to your community .

I personally believe that experience and practice is what makes a person perfect , according to the proverb `` Practice makes perfect . '' One needs to have some sort of experience in an area to be successful ; for example a previous mistake or a wrong decision that has been made .  To begin with , I would like to give an example of my personal experience . In the summer of the year 2007 , I had dislocated my knee during a physical education class at school . We were playing kickball and it was my turn to kick the ball and run . Due to the slippery floor of the court , I had slipped and almost broke my left leg . It took me a large amount of time to start walking , running and even sitting again , and the doctor had forbidden me from playing any sorts of sport again , as there was a big risk that the same accident would happen again . However , I did not listen to the words of the doctor and started playing basketball , my favorite sport , as soon as I was able to run again . I even joined the Varsity Girls Basketball Team of my school . Now the season is over , and I am glad that I took the risk . However , if I hurt myself again , I would never regret what I did , because I would take a lesson out of it : not to disobey my parents and my doctor again .  Another example of taking risks and trying new things would be joining the chess club of my school . I had never played chess in my entire life , but as soon as I joined the club , my knowledge of logical thinking has flourished . I enjoy playing the game , even outside of the club , and I am proud that I took the risk and joined the club , even though I was nervous and shy at the beginning .  Some people tend to hate seafood , while others can not live without it . I believe this is a matter of choice and sometimes a matter of experience . Disregarding people who have allergies , an ordinary human being would enjoy eating something if they were raised eating it . I am a seafood fanatic , and therefore adore eating Japanese food . Sushi , the most common type , is something I eat every week . Some of my friends , however , highly dislike Sushi . My best friend at school had never tried eating Sushi in her life , but she told me about her hunger for seafood several times . Therefore , I took her to a Japanese restaurant once , trying to convince her to eat Sushi . She did not want to eat it at first , however when she tried it , she absolutely loved it . Now , every week me and her go to our favorite destination , the Japanese Restaurant .  Experience is something that happens once in a life time , and can be used numerous times for different things . I believe that trying new things and taking risks , such as visiting different countries and riding the fast train in an amusement park , will expand a person 's overall knowledge and turn them to an open-minded person .

Old people were a young people at their old times . They did what young people are doing know . They are experienced about what life looks like . They also enjoyed their life at that time . This is the reason why , they always give sugestion to young people about what do they have to do about enjoying their boriying lifes .  First they can not do what young people are doing wity using their fresh bodys anymore . Exactly they want to do that movements which young people do but their bodys do n't let them to do . They can not what is going on becouse they were so healtful and they could what they wantted to do with using their legs , their hands and other organs , but they ca n't use these organs anymore . It 's like drama for them which they are acting main charecter .  Second young people are excited to that becouse this a new field foe them ; they were born and they were n't try this life in mother stomach , life is starting at the beggining for them . It 's normal to try everthing . espesially for fun . Human beings can be live on this earth only one time and you can not chose your end so human beings must be enjoy their lifes . Young people are much more brave then old people becouse they can do eveything they want to do with their bodys but old people ca n't don that kind of actions . they have reguluar lifes and they support their childrens to do what they personally can not do anymore . Young people enjoy when their childs can do what they said to them . They really enjoy when the childrens listen their sugestions .  For my oppinion young people have adventages about enjoying their lifes and young people know what will be at the future .	TUR
The one of my favorite hobby is traveling . I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I think , when I travel without any tour guide , I can go any place which I would like to go , and I can find my favorite places or things , and I can get more strong friendships .  Fistly , without any tour guide , our travel will be more flexible for planning where to go or when to go . In my case , when I traveled with a tour guide , there was the place where I wanted to stay for more longer time , but he said `` we must go to next . '' I felt unsatisfied .  Secondly , it is possible for me to find a place or a thing which is not so famous . That is to say , I will get my own special place or thing . I do not like crowded place , so if I can find unfamous , but very good place or thing for me , I think I am happy .  Finally , if there is no guide for our group , we will get togehter to make our travel more precious . I have a friend good at making a schedule , so with her I feel more happy , and our travel will become more valuable , moreover , our friendship will become more strong .  For these reasons , I think the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide is not so good . Traveling is very exciting , so I wish I could go everywhere .	JPN
In these days a lot of people especially old people claims young people do not heve enough time to helping their communuties . The old people around me are complaining the same problem . However , i do not share their idea . In my opinion young people tries to give time to help the charity but they have n't got enough time because of the rush oh the twentieth century , Young people heve a lot of work to do but not enough time to spent in this century . However they spent a lot of time to their communities , For instance they are visiting their familiy in every celebration . If they have they gave it to the poof people . For example last night in a television show a lot of people gave money to a charity to plant trees and most of people who gave money to charity were young people . Actually There was n't any old people there , This an remarkable point , a lot of people say young people are guilty about this topic but may be old people are guilty  There is an adage which comes from hitits , In a hitit paper an old people was complaining about young peoples . it shows that complaining from young people has never changed , The people living in twenty second century may be complain from ypung peoples too , However it does n't mean young peoples are not gining enough time ,  In conclusion , the young people living in twentieth century gives enough time to their comunity , even they have got a lot of jobs to do , we can see the from the television shows or if we look at histoery we will see the same complainings , this is typicall thing so the old people has to get r 'd of the'r complainings ,	TUR
I do agree with the statement , and i would substaniate my stance in the succeeding paragraphs . Primarily the rate at which environment is getting polluted its tough to imagine people having an oppurtunity in using an automobile leave alone a car . Ofcourse many eminent people and reformers have joined forces to save environment from pollution it can be jus regarded as a beginning . or a rennaissance in twenty first century going by the no of dramatic reforms , protests going on inorder to save `` MOTHER EARTH ''  Basically in day-to-day activities in the modern day scenario a vehicle has become a basic amenity . By vehicle i meant a car because on an average every 2 people to 8 people use a car in developed , developing nations . A car was a necessity earlier or a mark of an aristocrat or his associate . But these days it has become the order of the day to use a plush car even tough thier 's no impending need for it . Going by the designs that are introduced in the market `` at the drop of a hat '' by the manufacturers in many nations its indeed tough to imagine a pollution free environment . They are reaping rich profits and soaring unparalleled heights as far as their bank balance is concerned .  I do not mean that pollution is caused only by uncontrolled vehicle usage , but this definetly plays the most significant role in contributing to enivronmetal degradation . It was given in an article of ` National Geographic channel 's magazine ' regarding the hazardous effects of the increase in the no of cars in this century and their subsequent contribution to the degradation cycle . And uts astonishing to note down that a staggering 42 percent of pollution is contributed by vehicular pollution . So in the wake of so many facts coming to light and few developed nations , superpowers like China amending laws to protect the environment and more importantly making their citizens abide by the laws it just might be a tough going for car manufacturers in the future . Actually people do not use vehicles in venice which is supposed to be the pollution free state in the world  But there 's a possibility of some one coming out with a break through like say an eco friendly car , probably we might to turn to that car . Goin by the theory of uncertainity its highly unlikely that cars can be operated with same regularity in future owing to laws of nature , demanding circumstances like environmental degradation and spread of various health hazards there 's a bleak future for various car manufacturers who have earned money tht'l cushion future generations . I feel that there 's an urgent need to address the problems of pollution , health hazards resulting from the harmful gases an automobile may emanate . As they say `` PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THEN CURE '' .we should take note of these problems and strive o find a fitting solution to the already dilapidated environment	TEL
Good and hard question . I think this question 's answer is not yes or no . Because young people have got alot of enercy and movement , but they have not got a lot of money : )  So , they young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . young people 's mind is is heavy . they like play game , party and another thing . I think they dont know their responsible . For example A student is very work your lessons . but you dont it . Why ? Because he is lazy . is good than work .  Their know are swiming and playing and another activite and freedom . Immm . I think very bad sentences .	TUR
Now a days young people are giving enough time to support their communities , the young people have to their responsibilities they have to work for there community if the people make them to avoid from helping their community they may face sopme problems in the future .  If our whole society helping to the poor people then the country will be good and we wont find any illitrate in t he country society have arise and make help to the poor people . For example : if one helps to any poor guy we have to encourage so that he can make more or we have to help them by the capability we can help .  Here the problem for the young people if they concentrate on helpng htere community they may lost there knowlegde in the education side and they may not capable to concentrate on the studies and may not be help full to the country .  Young people now a days do not give enough time to helpng their communities because they are not motivated by any one person to do help for community every one is preffering to do their own feel they have to be happy . Especially young people are more intrested in enjoyment .  To make young people to help for the community they have to motivated by some one who can leads the role for the youth by that the young people will be give enough time to helping the community .  Here i want to say that the young have to all the works which are required to them helping to the community is not a big work to them by that they can know responsibilities about the community . If we ask them to do suddenly they may not intrested in the work .  If the young people thing to work for their community they can built a good country of their own and get good name to them . They have to improve the helping nature by motivating the others the community .  Every thing as its own advantages and disadvantages ,  Advantages :  Young people can know the responsibility of their own and can be inspiration to the other generation .  They can be easy connected to the others and get any help when ever they required of some help .  Disadvantages :  Young will may effect the education if they concentrate on helpin to the community .  They may miss some valuable part of education and they will be as illitrate .	TEL
with the developments in the technology , there are more new transpotation vecihles invented . one of most important invetnion is the invention of car . with this invention , a lot of developments occured in people 's life . it porvides a lot of opportunity in transportation - especially shortens the time passing on ways . however the invetions causes many problems in terms of enviroment and the daily city life . thus I do agree with the statement claiming that in in twenty years there will ne fewer cars in use that there are today since people become more aware about utilizing a car and the new regulations of the governments in terms of the protection of the enviroment and mesures to decline problems about daily city life .  the main environmental problem are arised by the use of car is air pollution . as to the statistics more use of car cause more pollution due to gases produced by a car motor thus nowadays people are more aware about this danger . thus they may tend to use their car less to prevent the air pollution .  the use of car also leads to problems about daily city life such as trafic jam . because most of people living in the city have cars , traffic is generally overcrowded so people waste a lot of time to arrive where they want to go . due to this problem they start to use the public transportation instead of using their own car .  in short because of the enviromental problems and the daily city life problems people tend to use f	TUR
The issue that will be discussed here is whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities or not . Some might say that young people are more educated today to be ever of the problems in their community and more enthusiastic to help . While on the other hand some might say that Young people today are too busy in their own life set up to look beyond it and help their communities . Well , I would agree with the first set of people who think that Young people nowadays take out enough time to help their communities .  Firstly , the reason I think that young crowd nowadays give enough time to help their communities is because they are more educated and are aware of the problems that lies in their community in which they have grown than the young people of generation before this . Lets take an example of a young man who has faced difficulties in his childhood because of lack of good schools in his village . Now that he has somehow managed to get education and get a good job in a multinational company , he knows the benefits of good educational facilities . He knows with his experience and exposure to the world that his village can grow and develop if the children can get good education . So he would take out time to put conscious efforts in the development of his village .  Secondly , taking the same example of this young man who is employed in a good company also earns well as compared to the young people before . He has enough money to help the people in his community and will to change the infrastructure to facilititate the younger generation in thier development .  Finally , I believe the younger generation today are more enthusiastic and are filled with more jest to take out extra time to change the conditions existing in their community and help the people who need it . The education system today has changed which teaches more moral values and inculcate a sense of responsibilty in the younger generation to help their community and their country . The young people today have learned to prioritise their work and have become more effective in managing their time .  So I think the today 's generation are more effective in helping their community .	HIN
Knowledge `` Its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . '' I agree on this statment because knoeledge saves alot of people from a lot of dangerous things .  `` A little knowledge is dangerous . '' I have faith in this saying lets take the medicines such as pain killers as an example . People with a little knowledge mite think that taking more pain killers will help killing the pain faster , in the other hand well educated people will rialize that taking over dose of pills will have a lot of side affects on the person who takes these pills , thats why a person must have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . This does n't mean that the person must be well educated in every thing because the saying says : `` A man of all trades is master of none . '' It 's hard to know each detail of every thing in life because this will rouin your focus at the important thing in each subject in life .  My advice to every one is to try to educate your self in every thing and this does n't mean to go through details in every thing . But each person must have a specipic subject to know every thing about , and try to gain informations from different people you meet in your life with different education because : `` Christmas comes but once a year .

I agree with the statement that successful people try new things because it was their risk that was responsible for the technologies we are enjoing in our present life .  There are many situations that would support the above point some of them are if we take the field of restaurents then we are seeing that many established restaurents are always trying to keep their presence in a new way and also we can say that people are also enjoying that . So that we can strongly say that these hotels trying in a new way was helping them .  In the case of automobiles also these companies are trying to follow the new ways and are also these companies were investing a lot of amount on the research and developmet and were providing their customers with better facilities to satisfy their customers who will be wishing to go for a better one .  From these examples we can get that trying new was always better but it was also having some drawbacks and if they go in a wrong way it may leed to their destruction , so they should be concious while going for the new way .  Risk was must in this competitive world and with out that we can not be taht successful in our life so a successfull person cannnot stand on the same thing because he was successful only becasuse of the risks they had taken in their lifes .  Finally it was clear that notonly those successful men every body should go for risks to enjoy a great life of achievemets . We have some living examples like some bussiness legends who reached the peaks of their bussiness and were preparing themselves in social service .  No body can walk with out falling often , so nothing can be achieved with the risk .	TEL
I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . I think success has a great deal to do with factor of adaptation to the new environment , improvement of their own methods and challenging spirits . People who have these factor tend to new things and take risks .  First , successful people try new things and take risks to adapt the new environment . The environment around us has rapidly changed recently . For example , the invention of Internet makes world borderless and email shortens the time to convey the information . Under these circumstances , we have to adapt it to success . In order to adapt it , we should try new things , or new environment , and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . For example , most related to the IT industries are successful because they can adapt the new environment earlier that ordinary people . This is because they try to launce new things which no one did n't .  Second , successful people try new things and take risks to improve of their own methods . I thinks that doing the same things such as doing what they already know how to do well provides only the same consequense . There are no improvement and progress . In such cases , we can not be success because success has to do with something superior to otheres . In other words , even if the methods are superior to others at one time , it is the same level or inferior to others for a while . For instance , Ichiro Suzuki , who is a major league baseball player , continues to seek the new butting method to improve it every year . Needless to say , he is one of the most successful people .  Third , successful people tend to have challenging spirits . I thinks that it is important to do new things . Doing new things brings us new skills and discoveries . Those lead to being success .  In conclusion , I agree with the statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for the main three reasons stated above .	JPN
As peoples ' ages change , they begin to enjoy different pleasures in life . Young people have fun and feel very pysched at times when they believe they are being praised by others . I remember , for a while in my life , anytime I would walk into someplace with a slick and snazzy new haircut , I would believe people looked up to me , and it would be for the rest of the night that I 'd enjoy myself , due to my newly installed confidence . However , no matter how illogical it is , that would be my almost only way of having fun .  Today , I have fun when I am with close people such as my good friends or family . I also enjoy locking myself up in my room and programming websites . Three years ago , I would mock someone who would tell me such a thing . I would n't consider fun , and on the contrary I would consider it ridiculously boring .  For my parents , they have fun playing the slowest card game ever ( which I think is called Bezik ) . At this age , I do n't understand how they consider that to be fun . They also enjoy going on boat trips . To me , nothing could be more monotonous than the empty sounds of the lonely sea .  However you never know , maybe in around 30 years , those may be my pleasures in life . Maybe , I will begin jogging every morning by six a.m. at the age of sixty . What my pleasures will be , is certainly not certain . The same applies to everyone .  Therefore , I do n't believe that the question posed can be answered . I believe all age groups have their own way of having fun . You can not compare one 's actions to another one 's actions , if the actions have their own definition for each individual .	TUR
I recently read an article about supporting groups , which have to face the situation of very low activity participating rates among their members and lack of new applications . Since I also lead a supporting group for keeping clean our city park , I can confirme this tendence and I agree with the statement .  I ca n't stop asking why young people do n't want to be involved in activity , which can improve the life quality in their community . Lack of time is the first most popular answer . Nowadays youngsters are very busy : if the school does n't give them enough homework , parents will find some extrascholastic activities . Friends are also important , and something done with them seems to them to have more worth than something done for the community .  Helping the community brings not only benefits to the community itself , but also to who participates in the activity . Staying together is essential for a social animal like the human being .  In conclusion , more should be done to involve young people to help the community . School and parents should be the first to promote such activities , showing the benefits that can be achieved , and not holding people back !	ITA
I do agree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . '' To understand ideas and concept is not very easy but once you understand , to know the facts is easy job i think .  I would like to talk about based on my experience , when i was study i used to learn facts first then try to understand ideas . That was a huge mistake for me , i thought i understood what i learnt but it was not . I was understood totally different way so i had to study again which takes much more time . Also when we had group work i was the one who always give wrong suggestions and it was very embarasing in fornt of my friends . So , from that point i decided to change which was understand ideas first and learn facts . It was little hard for me at the first time but time goes by it was much easier for me to learn facts after understood ideas . Well not only that , after I understood ideas and concepts i had a lot of questions to ask and opinions to suggest . Also time that i spent on to understand became much more shorter so i can study other things as well . In the class I was the one who never ask questions and suggest my opinions in class but i changed . How ? I became the one whos most talkative in class because to understand what i learnt i had so many things to ask and want to know . So i knew from that time , because i did n't understand the concept i had no questions to ask and no interest to think about that topic . From my experience i do strongly agree with the statement .  To do easy work or better work , to understand what is the idea and concepts are the first thing to do then learn fact will be the faster way to learn from my opinion .	KOR
The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a statement I can totally agree with and my opinion is based on several factors .  First off , the main reason of traveling usually is to explore the place visited , and see the beautiful attractions in it . That 's why it is necessary to find a professional and experienced local to guide you to the places because he knows his job and he knows what he 's doing so he would with no doubt take you to the places often tourists admire like : beautiful scenes and natural beauties .  For an example , I remember when I went with my family to Egypt . I remember we met this young woman who was appointed to meet us as our tour guide . I ca n't find words to describe how excellent were her choices and how greatly were we satisfied with the places we have seen and the activities we 've taken part of , since we saw most of the breath-taking attractions in Giza like : the Pyramids , Sphinx and the national museums in that area where we had this short lesson about hyroglyphs . Also getting a tour guide who 's also local can make a splendid combination because you ca n't find someone who 'd try hard to show you places in his town to make you love the place like a local .  Second off all , by getting a touring guide you can avoid some great deal of trouble you may face if you were all alone . Touring guides often accompanied with security guards who 're common and familiar with situations that can cause some tourists a kind of unhappiness , or make them uncomfortable or in worst cases be in danger such as : getting caught in the overwhelming traffic , being lost , get a good deal of disturbance by beggars , or even in worst cases being endagered by tourist-targeting criminals .  So that 's why I do think that tour guides are a must , instead of going solo , getting unsatisfied with what you see and give the place you visit a bad name as a result of that choice you 've taken .

I disagree with the following statement . Because from now so many people buy the cars , and also so many people use a lot of cars . So even in twenty years there will be not fewer cars in use than there are today . Also another reason of this statement is now so many cars come out after a mouth of year or after 1 year . And some people buy one car , after that they buy new car . Because the new car is good design and good looking . So many in twenty years there will be so many cars in more use than there are today , and also there will be a lot of new cars are coming out .	KOR
If the `` success '' means economical or scientifical success ( big money or new deveropment ) , I agree with the statement . Recently , the people 's life becomes more convinient because of the development of industry , and more homogenius in the means of infomation because of the progress of communication technology like internet . So relatively comfortable life can be achieved by the routine task , or work . It means new chalanges are not necessory for common life , so many people seem not to like trying new matters . The chalanges is more impotant now ! In the field of science , new result only derived from new chalanges or ideas . Already known works only make already known results . In the economical sense , also new chalange sometimes makes big success . But economical chalanges always bring some risks and easily become gamble , so we should manage our total risk .  But l think it is also important to keep the traditional matters , theorys and caltures . They can be the basis of new one . And we can avoid some failures and accidents from previous one . So in the means of `` importance '' , or `` Important people '' , I can not choose one from these two .	JPN
I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of many things . First and the most important thing is that the advertisements are made to sell products so it only talks or shows the adventages of the products and they never mention the disadventages or the side effects of the products so people can only see the good site of this product and buy it . second there are products that are developed by more than one company which starts a competition between them and ofcource since advertisements have a great role in the selling process of the products , these companies tries to make their products looks better than the other companies so they starts to show some non major adventages that do n't really exist in the product to win the competion although big companies with big names wo n't do this because it will effect their reputition but sometimes it may happens . Third companies wo n't pay to advertise its products except if they are sure that it will get them more profits so if the advertisement does n't make the product fits with the customers needs , the companies wo n't make advertisement to its products . Last thing is that the art of advertisement has a concept to make a product looks much better than they really are and here is an example .  The film trailers and game trailers they are always made in a way so that people go watch this film or game after seeing the trailer but when they watch the film or buy the game they do n't find them as they expected	ARA
People get education because the knowledge serves as the background setting for young adults which means that those complex math questions or the dates for a historical events are not applied directly on the society . Thus , if I have to choose between understanding ideas and concepts on certain subject or learning facts , I would choose to understand ideas and concepts . There are two reasons for agreeing with the statement .  The first reason is because if you focus on understanding ideas and concepts , you can obtain knowledge much easier and faster . This is because when you try to obtain ideas and concepts to yours , it is easier to concentrate as the process of learning them is fun and interesting . For example , when I get the report cards from school , I could divide them into two groups . The subjects with high grade were the subjects I understood the concepts and ideas very well . The other group is consist of low grades which I considered boring and waited the class to end . As you see from my experience , the quality of outcome differs whether you understand ideas or just try to learn facts . This shows why it understanding is more important than learning facts .  The next reason is that the ideas and concepts you understand remains for longer time . This reason is conceivable among people . In my case , I still remember the math formulas I understand in my high school days . This is because if you understand the ideas or concepts as yours , it can be applied to other areas thereby the formulas or other facts can be used and remembered on and on even you become old .  To sum up , the two reasons presented above shows why understanding facts is more curcial than just learning facts . Understanding facts helps your knowledge be installed in your brain in shorter amount of time with positive attitude towards it , and can be applied to other spheres as well . As I have experienced variety of cases related to this statement during my high school life , I strongly agree with the statement .	KOR
The best way to train and improve our intelligence is to make the brain work by understanding and analyzing different concepts . Therefore I definitely agree with this statement : brain 's exercises are more usefull and important than memoy 's exercises .  The first step in the education of any human brain is to learn how to study and understand a new idea . Learning by memorizing new facts is only a mechanical exercise that can not increase our intelligence . Therefore if we can understand a concept , we will be able to remember it and it will be part of our knowledge for ever .  Sometimes students try to learn facts because they think that it is an easyer way to learn ; but this idea is completely wrong . Only understanding the real and essential meaning of a new concept , the student will be confident and able to use it in his future .  In addition , it 's important to underline that the rule of teachers is to encourage students to analyze and study new ideas . For example , I remember in my high school the support of my favourite teacher who was trying to teach me how important is to study deeper any subjects instead of learn facts .  In conclusion , I want to emphatize again the importance to understand ideas and concepts because is the best way to increase our knowledge and our intelligence : that is the real exercise for the human brain . .

In my opinion enjoyment have avery different meanings . it varies from one perspective to other . some people think that singing dancing or other entertainment is enjoyment . and others think that reading books , helping others watching the nature is their kind of enjoyment . so if we think about age group mostly younger people wants to enjoy life more than the older people . whatever ma be the type of enjoyment younger people wants to do it copletely without hesitations , restrictions .  Young age is the only stage in the life where everyone full of colous , ambitious . the peoples feelings are just like beautiful butterflies . eventhough now a days the younger generaation baame so competitive , careeroriented , they just dont want to suppress their joys . they are sharing their happiness , sadness . they are going to discos , concerts , cinemas . here exactly the older genaration is opoosing the younger ones .  Old people are usally more mature and behaves like a stioic to the sitations . they take whaeever comes in their life in the same way because their experiences taught them a lot in their life .  one imortant reason for this variations in enjoyment is differances in the hormanal leval . as the person becomes old his hormonal influences become less evident . their enjoyment levels and expressions directly corresponds with it .  Even though some exceptions for this are ther but on the whole , younger people enjoyment is higher than the older people . in my house also i want to celebrete all the festivals in a grand way . but my parents are always restricting me to that . though at that moment i feel bt later in my life who knows that i might do the same thing !  So in my opinion in general youngsters enjoy more than the old age groups . the reasons might be hormonal influences or attitude towards life or theeir experiences or they know the value of the monet better .

First of all , I strongly disagree the idea of young people enjoy life more than older people do . I am thinking that older people could enjoy their life .  Evidently , young people are busy to prepare their future life . Specially , after starting school , they spend the most of time to study and learn skills . Also , they have a lot of questions of real life as they are growing and try to figure out the problelm through talk with friends or parents . They could enjoy life to spend time with friends but this is not enjoying . I would like to say that is one of learning how to stand between people in our society .  Some young people are not like that I mention in above . They are just spend time for fun . They do not thinking about their future . However , in this case is not only for all of young generation .  On the other hand , older people could enjoy their life . They have comfortable time and money . Older people who have a career on their job and good health , of caurse they can do . Also , it cuold be good model to young gerneration . Even my parents usually have a short trip together on weekend . When I see them , I am very envy them and I could have a chance to think about my life .  There are many kind of way to enjoy life and everyone do . I support that many older people do comfortably enjoy life .	KOR
According to risk taking there are two types of people ; one of which hates taking any kind of risky attempt and the other is ready in orderto try new things and take risks . According to my oppinion people should be enough courages to take risks so that they could make inventions , innovations and businesses .  New foundations , inventions are born from the risk taking attemps . Today we are in the space era thanks to those risky ideas and doings . When we think about humanbeings first space travel . The possiblity of returning alive is not much . . Full of risk gave its result so that new space station s cqan be establishedd . there can not be any scientists who could make his invention without trying risky experiments . Edison could invent electric after his unlimited number of unsuccessful experiments . He sacrified much in terms of risks attemps  Additionally in the bussiness life we see that the firms could be established with a risk involment . Noione can predict whether or not his firm will make money or not . But there are many examples of bussiness men who began the entreprise with bank credits or loans with higher interest rates which means that he must earn with a higher rate . this is also risk taking . What is done to start and even to run a new firm . is also risk taking . Without risktaking nothing new can not be founded .  In brief in order to achive new thing like inventions and to make bussiness the very first need is risk taking ability . we are living in space era because of the risks taken . There exist firms thank to risk taking idea	TUR
There are some people young people how do not give much important in helping their communities , they preoccupied in their own world . They get enough time in doing all the other work and for helping for their communities they will run away , and these are the people after sometimes are the ones who will be living in the same community . They should be remembering only onething that if today they dont help their community , there will be a day where you need some help from them and on that day nobody will be their to help you . If we are not ready to help ourself no one will help as .  When we are leaving in a common place and we have to learn to help eachother , by this we can leave without any troubles . If we leave like onday day will come were their wouldnt be any problems in the world . By this we could leave as aonecoplete family , this what we all need to do ateleast try to help eachother , and i think this happening for ex if we take globalisation is the medium through which we are comming to one place and all rich countries are helping the poor countries in a way they could this an example for their are people who are will to hep .  We can not also say that young people are not helping their community their some young people who are creating awareness among different sectors of people of the importants of helping one another . They are forming groups and forming communities for those who are in need of help .  So this suggest that their are a section of young people who are willing to help other people and communities , but the percentage of these people are less and we need to increase this habbit and make sure that everybody inculcates this practice .

There has been an argument about which is better ; having broad understanding in many topics or specialized knowledge in one specific subject . When it comes to academic subjects , I think that specialization is essential because of following reasons .  Almost all areas of knowledge require professional specialists to handle and develope them because they are very complicated nowadays . It is true that our society needs generalists who have wide range of knowledge , but generalists ' knowledge is based on the specialists ' works in each area . It is specialists who make a new discovery and produce knowledge , having the ability to perform sound researchs on each specific subject . That 's why I assert that specialists ' role is primary .  Moreover , having broad knowledge is an easy job for everyone because sharing information is easier than ever before . We can easily search for the lastest knowledge in books and internet . This makes the generalists ' role unsignificant to be a generalist especially in these days .	KOR
I am disagree with the statement because I think that the older people enjoy life more than young people . In fact I think that today a young people have every thing that he or she wants and therefore does n't fight to conquest his dream or his desire . Therefore after a bit time the young people is tired , because he knows that he can have everything .  In opposite , an older people knows how to fight for conquest his dreams because in the last time there are less things . In addition today there are more and more problems in opposite the last time , because the society is become more industrialized and the people are always quickly . This troubles causes a generally unhappy and the young people doens't enjoy his life . Therefore I think that today when a young people says that he is happy , it is n't true , but there is a way to hide a generally unhappy .	ITA
We all pass by difficult moments in our lives that will help us gain experience . I agree with the qoute that say 's `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , for many different reasons . A person who try 's new things in his life , will gain experience and knowledge . Taking risks and learning new things will develop a person emotionally and physically . It is a good thing for a person to be adventurous , and go through different kind 's of situation 's , because it helps him learn new things and lessons in life . By learning these new lesson 's , and by being more experienced , a person will suddenly see himself optimistic , and happy . His reason for living will increase , because he will love life more , and would like to do new stuff that will entertain , and teach him . I think that a risk taker is a very confident person , that know 's what he want 's in life , and he is lucky to have this characteristic . It is a positive action that each person must choose to sucsseed in live , unlike the peolpe that only do what they know . These people that are not risk taker 's will eventually find themselves not capable of doing anything in life . They will regret not being risky , and not doing and trying everything new in life , and will hope and wish for time to go back , and do whatever they did not do . The difference between these two kinds of people is that one is ready and willing to learn new things and lesson 's in live , while the other is being self-relient , scared , and lazy , and he will not sucsseed in live as much as the confident , risk taker . In conclusion , taking risk will never affect a person in a negative way . It will help a person to have a great self-esteam , will make his confidence grow , and will make him successful in any situation he is going to face in life .	ARA
Teaching , learning , studying : it 's all a method ! During our school and college years , we have all had the chance to experience many teaching methods throughout our professors . When some teachers believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , other believe that what matters is learning the facts .  During lectures , Professors try to pass along a certain idea or concept to his students . Undoubtedly , lectures are too theoratical and not too exciting , but remain essential . What will the student remember on the day of his exam from his lectures ? What is he supposed to remember ? I believe that part of making studying an enjoyable experience , is understanding the material we are studying . Once we have understood the material , it is printed logically in our heads .  Understanding a lesson begins with understanding the ideas and concepts , as they form the essence of the material . But to understand the ideas and concepts , especially when it comes to complex ideas and concepts , it seems useful to start by learning the facts .  Learning the facts makes you understand the ideas and concepts more easily .  For example , if a student wants to understand Einsten 's concept of relativity , a revolutionary concept in physics , it would better to start with the facts . Once the student would have understood the facts about the relativity concept , he could be more capable of understanding the concept as a whole .  Therefore , i believe that it is as important to understand ideas and concepts , as it is to learn facts : the two being linked to one another , leading to a better understanding of the material .

As the young generations of children and teeangers continue to display themselves as unique , wild , and crazy , people tend to think they do not contribute to the community or promote altruism . In fact , they tend to think young people do the opposite . This assumption is not entirely a fabrication . There are countless of children who are willing up to give up their time to help the community . These occurences can be observed anywhere , especially in school . Several schools offer a myriad of student activities that help their communities , which students volunteer generously .  The most popular program among the students are orphanage or retirement home visits . Students voluntarily sacrifice their time afterschool to take the hike to an orphanage or retirement home nearby . During these visits , students play with the children , exchange conversations with the elderly , help clean up trash around the area , all in all , promoting warmth and happiness to the community . Undoubtedly , these generous acts promote a better environment .  Another program includes Amnesty International , which takes helping communities to an international level . Students organize themselves into groups and become aware of social and political injustice around the world . With knowledge , they promote social awareness and facilitate active political participation to fellow students by writing letters to governments . Being future leaders of the world , not only are they aggregating interests to governments for the community , they are influencing others to become equally aware of the world around them .  Undeniably , sometimes young people do become lazy and not help the community . They rather enjoy luxurious times in front of the television or playing video games . Sometimes young people just need their relaxation time and enjoy themselves as kids . A childhood must also be dominantly characterised by exuberance . Furthermore , there will always be other more responsible kids doing more helpful work for the community to counterbalance the laziness of others .  Benevolence and sacrifice is an indication of maturity . Countless of young people already help the community voluntarily as seen in the various successful school activities . However , young people are still growing and adapting . If they are n't , we should n't hinder the process and let them enjoy their childhood .	CHI
I firmly belive that recently young people doesnt have enogh time to pay attentioning to their communities . I am going to give some reasons to support my opinion .  First , in moder world society is being busy and there are many things going on . I think young people is much busier than old time . Study is getting hard and hard young people may need spend more time on that . Becasue they want to get better job and better life in future which may give us happy feeling . However , i belive they will forget about important things as they focus on to the only study .  For instance friendship , helping people , caring parents and brothers and sisters . Volunteer is one of the good idea . They helpong people and they are learnd something from it at the same time . Therefore they shold make time to helping their communities .  Second , i personally think it is a such a excuse . Because actually young people have time . .. even they are studying very hard at that stage they will have . If this kind of young people continue to inclise i would concern about the future . Because helping society is needed for our life . It is essential and to be familiar with the people and community .  We could find improtant things from there and it will be useful for our future .  Still some may say young people do not care about this , I think they belive because it is only short time that young people enjoyning thire life . Nevertheless , I belive to helping somethign is essentialf for us to live in this world whatever that is .  Thus students shuld make time to helping their communities .  In conclusion , I would ague that it is better to give the enogh time to young people more often . Therefore parents should care about their children seriously to tell them to make a time to do the helping communities . I hope the young peple will think about this statement more carefully and wish luck to the future wourld .	JPN
I agree with this statement . If a student once has understood an idea or a concept , he is able to increase his knowledge easily without learning a lot of facts . He will without doubt learn facts , but not because someone tells him the facts , but because his increasing interest of the subject . And the interest increase because he understand the idea/the concept of a system .  The global warming for example : If a student once understand the connection between the increasing temperature and the effect of the climate , he is able to look deeper , to see how everything is connected . This can be a very fascinating experience . It is also importent , to have an inspiring teacher who knows , how to fascinate his students . If this is the case , the teacher does n't have to bother the students with boring facts , he just has to explain the idea/concept of a system properly .  It is also important to give the students time and support to find out things by themselves . The result is an increasing self confidence . I guess it is like a vicious circle in a positive kind of way . Once a student has gain more self confident , his interest in the matter is growing , the researches are getting more intense , the results are also getting more accurate and he will learn the facts as a result of his interest , because he wants to know the background .  He does n't need to have a boring lesson to learn the facts . If he once understand an idea , the student is able to	GER
I agree with the idea that most advertisements is better than the products itself . For example , when I read fashion magazines I find many attractive pages which appeal various products such as cosme , dress , watch , and perfume . Whenever I look at these kinds of pages , actually I feel like buying them immediately .  The one reason why people have interset with advertisements when looking it is that it usually use female model whose style is good and it always looks very enjyoable to use the products . It attracts people and urge them to buy and wear them . Sometimes people tend to forget that they do n't have same face , style and atmosphere with the model . It 's a fault . After obtaining products , people feel it 's not better than expected because people do n't really need it .  The another reason why most advertisement is nice-looking for people is it 's quality . To compete with other companies and get a big share of market , companies make efforts with various way , in particular for advertisements . A recent reserch shows that 90 percent companies in fashion field consider they should spend money and time to produce an advertisement . For example , to hire famous designer costs 10 times higher than salary of one employee month .  Consequently the quality of advertisements sometimes win the real product itself .  For these reasons , I support the position of considering that most advertisements seems much better than the products itself .	JPN
At the mean time , the world 's most centered problem is about world piece . Palestine , Irak , Afghanistan are some countries where guilt and war can be found . These wars happening in our world can be an effect from the cause of imaturity and irrespnosibilty young people nowadays are having towards the prespectives of their cultures , societies and themselves .  In the old days , Education was one of important needs poeple might consider . That is because of the great enthusiasim young people might be having towards accomplishing their responsibilties . For example , the precentage of failure in Senior - high shool was 30 % in the Middle East between 1989-2000 . However , between 2001-2006 the precentage of failure has been highly increased to 70 % . This statistic tells that young people nowadays are not having the potential to accomplish their reponsibilities , in order to respond it to several generations after them . This also may cause the communitity and the society to have a lack of Education that might effect the city with it 's financials .  Money has been one of the main problems the society is having . Everyone is so concerned about their financial problems this may cause us to forget about the needs and the improvements our society might mostly need . This problem might inheret itself throught the coming generations in a way that could effect young people 's enthusiasim towards accomplishing their responsibilities .

I agree with this statement . Basically , travel should be enjoyable and fun to talk many people on during tour group , not only people local cevilians . On a group tour have more chance to talk people than travel alone . First , traveler will be a friend with tour guide , that is a first oppotunity . There is many advantage that travel in a group led by a tour guide . First of all , travelers just follow tour guide . It is neccesary to make any tour plan or sightsee schedule . Just listen and see what tour guide explains and sightseeing spot . Travelers concentrate what ever they want to see or whatever they want to learn or listen . Secondly , travel with group led by a tour guide is safer . Tour guide have a responsibility to be in safe with travelers that means travelers do not go to any unpeace place . Even travelers does n't know sightseeing place is safe or not , definitely safe during tour . In case travel alone or no local friend , nobody know if travelers in unpeace place or not . It is danger . Thirdly , travel with group led by a tour guide will be convenience . Which means , travelers do n't wast a time as lost in place , do n't wast a money by cheat . As I mentioned above , sightseeing place and time schedule were scheduled by tour guide . So travelers going on schedule that means there is no way to wast time and see anything travelers want , and travelers going in safe place to buy such as in shopping mall or meal . There is no way to anyone cheat them . Those reasons are not only domestic travel . I can say it internatinal travel as well . I recommend to go to travel with group led by a tour guide especially internetinal travel . Without saying , people in foreign country speaks different lunguage than travelers and there is not peacefull place . Those are reasons why I agree with statement .	JPN
Advertisements are really needed for products , but extravagant publicity is to be militated . I agree with the following statement that Most advertisements make products seem much better than they are . firstly , advertiments should provide infomation that a product has . i mean the quality of the product ( whether it has reliability and garuntee ) . The advertisors using some showy labels , packings etc. , should stop . because they charge even for the packings which are expensive , ordinary people cant buy those things even they are daily house hold products which are necessary . secondly they use some celebrites for canvassing the product , they offer even some royalty from commodity sales percentage . thirdly , the advertisor attract the consumers , using graphic design and animation by showing them more fascinating than they really are . These kind of things really going to work on children for and makes there parents to buy for them . And dazziling stickers also makes them more attracting . all these will definetly increase the cost of commodity so i finally conclude these kind of avertisements , imean , iagree with the quote that `` most adertisments make products seem much better than they really are .

I am of the opinion that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . There are many reasons and examples that i would like to list in support of my position .  First let us consider those cases in which the author 's contensions , in fact my contensions , hold good . Firstly let us consider the field of science and technology . consider for example a biology student is faced with the problem of replacing the burned out fuse . If he do not have any knowledge about the electrical subject he may not be able to fix a very simple task .  Also a student of technology should have minimum idea of what medicine to take when a minor health problem arise . So a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary .  Secondly , if for example a student is confined to study only the history of his own country which is his specific academic subject then he may face problem when asked about the world history and some important events in the world history .  Thirdly , consider the example of desiging a computer . many people who do different tasks are involved in desiging a computer . if the person who designs a part of the computer do not understand the funtions of other parts and the link between those parts then a computer can not be designed .  Finally , also a person of sceince or technology may find difficulty in the bussiness world if he do not anything about the stock market . This can be extended even to politics . If the party members have idea only about their own party then they are at risk of losing their position if they do not have the knowlede about the other parties .  In sum , I would like to reiterate that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acdemic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject which helps an individual enhance his general knowledge in addition to the regular subject .

All of the student who is in all over the world , we must learn a lot of things and sometimes writing report , orgnize idea , taking examination and showing how much that your understanding is . Everytime we must know facts and specific information to when we present the ideas , make presentation correctly . So we must learn facts correctly because of if we do not know the facts , we can not understand really idea or concept and we understand more different thigs to concept ( or idea ) .  The first idea , we must learn facts more than concept for the understanding of correct idea ( concept ) . For example if we do not know the facts of nowadys world , we can not why we must learn history . We learn history because of contrasting nowadys and old types or just learning the how the historical world was . And , if we understand facts we can understand more easily about concept .  The second idea is we must understand fact for understanding concept . It means if we learn really about concept and some tips of facts in our brain the idea will be mixing and makes us confusing . For example of history , if we learn about only a lot of contry 's damage of world war second it is facts of history but it too specific and we are confusing that we are learning about the situation of each country 's damage or the world war second . in this situation we are learning about world war second , so to make us no confusing at the first we must learn about facts .  That is my opinion that we must learn the facts than ideas and concepts because of understanding what the important things and main idea is . Everytime studying about the main topic of major and understanding about the features . However the most important thing is to understand the features and use features to understand the main idea .

Broading kowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion . Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benifit more if the subejects are varied .  The main reason that broading knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world . they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too . If the subjects are limited , a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in . They will be satisfied to have the informations that are circuld around the environment they live in . I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge , but i 'm sure that the majority wont have that good knowledge . In other words , our society will be weak .  Also if knowledge is limited to omly one subject , scientist would n't have reached the success which they have today . For example , if Nuoten did n't bother to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground , i do n't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all . he could have spend his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason of gravity . I think that his effort in studying every single detail made him conclude the concept of gravity .  If i were given the choice in any university or in any school whether to study only my major or have additional subjects , i would choose to study both my major and other additional subjects . that way i will be not only well educated but also my mind will have a good understanding of the world which i 'm living in .

The issue of whether young people these days , give enough time to helping their communities or not , is an issue that has been debated on extensively over the last few years . I personally dont agree with the statement as i feel that young people still play their part in helping their communities . The issue comes up again and again because people just take the actions of these young people to heart without actually understanding the situations they face and seeing how things have changed for these young people over the years .  First , i have always noticed that it takes a thousand good deeds to be appreciated and just one bad deed to be cursed . Very often the actions of one person are taken as the trait of a group of people without actually knowing what these other individuals are like . A few bad examples have helped promote the idea that the young people nowdays dont care .  Secondly , a lot has changed in the life of young people . The world is a great deal more competitive today than it was ten years earlier . Everything from an education to an occupation demands much more . Time can not be taken for granted anymore and young people find themselves more and more time bound everyday . I dont think this aspect is completely understood . Yet you see these young people doing the best they can to help their communities . A simple example of this is how at the time of someones death everyone is there to lend a helping hand to the family which has suffered the loss , and at such occassions if you try to think about it its usual the young people who run around to help all the time .  Moreover , there are so many young people who have dedicated almost all their time to sever and help their communities . there so many young people either involved with or running NGO 's or organisations which deal with serious issues like education or ample food and shelter for their communities . These people have devoted all their time and energy for the betterment of their communities .  In the end i would just like to say that , there might never be a common agreement on this subject , but i firmly feel that the young people are doing their part . I guess all we really need to do is open our eyes and see the bigger picture and i have feeling that the results , like me , might not support the statement either .	HIN
I agree with this statement that sucessfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  consider scientist Einstein who had developed the power and light source for the world because he had done his experiment sixteen times and he saw the same result that is failure . But he never giveup himself and conducted the same experiment seventeenth time and at this moment he acheived a result and became one of the most recognizable person in the world . There are so many people in this way who try untill sucess meets them .  Now we look at the present technology and the innovations that are happening in the world . Before the centuries if a person want to develop the power there is no way for obtaining it . But another scientist named as Edison who is famous for his wooden block model bladeless trubine which is used to develop the power from the water . He might not be a sucessfull person at the beginning of the era but he conducted many experiments and revealed the result form greater risks and won an international award which is given by the American society .  I disagree with those people who will do the same things that they have already known . Because god had gifted the people with superficial knowledge and one has to aspire that knowledge and one should increase the potential skills to develop the new model . when the people do the things that were very known to them they will never obtain some thing different in their life and they are always seems to be in the same position . one should try for new things which involves risksand many huddles , but when you pass through the risks there will be a result waiting for you . so every one should try for a new thing . Let us consider an example the person named as NEWTON , because he was unaware that he will be the most sucessfull person inthe world in the feild of science . He was just sitting down the tree and suddenly an apple fell on him and he question himself immedaiately that how it falls and then as a result he discovered the Newtons law of motion . so i would like to conclude that when a person takes the risk and passes through the difficulties and hurldes instead of doing the same thing that was well known he will meet the sucess .

Yes . I do agree that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Advertisements infact in today 's world do not only mean the disposition of the product 's essential features and its looks . Instead they are supposed to be a glorified dispay of the product with the fake promise that it is and will prove out to be a very valuable product , which will indeed provide enough customer satisfaction . In some cases the promise may turn out to be true as it totally depends on the the company and the `` product '' , the real one .  Advertisements are supposed to be in some cases only heart winners ! I say only because the products of that same field , competitive products are all but equal in terms of quality or quantity they provide . Its only upon the marketing and advertising faculties of the organization if it can make it look `` much better than it really is '' . And only when it makes a place in the customers ' heart would it be sold and the profitsfor the company flourish .  In a world of competition , the manufacturer is compelled to make the product percieved as the best it can be . And indeed as supported by the studies of the current markets , the products that are well advertised are the most sought after by the particular segment customers . Indeed if you add a bit of sheen to your product or make it look bigger , better , `` tasty '' or tempting to the public on the T.V , magazines or any other means of the media , chances are that the customers in and except your clientele would be atleast somewaht lured the product . And though they might buy it only after careful examination of the product and considerable reviews from there friends , they are atleast ushered to go to the markets and check out how and what it really is . Now the actual sales of a product would obviously depend partially on how well it really resembles the advertisement `` glorification '' and partially on the competition it faces .  So in my opinion the advertisement in todays world is a neccessary part of the marketing process . As real it can be kept , it should be . But i would consider it compulsory to give a bit of weight to the product adn its features .	HIN
That is evident , life is not living in the same way when we are children or young adult and adults or aged persons . In my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do , and particularly very young people like children . I do not mean that being old is boring , but I think it is more exciting to be young . It recalls me a French proverb that said `` we are not every days twenty years '' .  First of all , it is a fact , children and teenagers are more insouciant than adults and elder people . They do not matter about any problems adults have oftently . Their only priority is to go to school . That leaves plenty of time to enjoy life .  By the way , young people have a lot of things to discover . Specially children who do not have any experience of life . Going to the cinema , to the zoo , to the circus , unable children to apprehend the world he is living in . A few years later , young adults will discover new aspects of life such as sexuality and human relationships .  Futhermore , young adults meet less problems than their parents . They are not still confronted by renting a house , paying insurrance , managing to get a job , et cetera .	FRE
I 'm not sure of this statement , I known a lot 40 years old more sad than older people . To make an example , my grandfather is 70 years old and he still enjoy life going around the world two times a year .  I like his love for life , and I hope I 'll have the same because if you do n't enjoy the life you should spend all the time sad and it is n't a good thing .  I do n't think that the age is so important to determin the love for life . Logically a young people can have more from the life than an old people if the speech is about the physics activity ; I can stay all night long or do many kilometers by bycicles . things that an old people ca n't do . But as I wrote before is closed to the physician charateristic .  The problem are that many young boy do n't ejoy life and I ca n't understand why . Too people in this time are sad maybe for the stress the fast of life-style that is concentrated only on work and stupid thinghs that you have to had to be similar to the other people .  I think that the statement is too restrictive , we ca n't say surely the young people are more attracted by life than old people because is not always true . Another example is about a professor who theaced me few years ago , he was not young however his behavior were like the behavior of a young boy : his vitality and his capacity to relate with my classmate ( young boy ) . luckly the people who go out with me are full of vitality , so I never spend my time boring myself like other people do . I say this becouse I know a lot of people who seems afraid of life and stay at home all the time watching tv while out the sun is bright .	ITA
It seems that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to help their communities , I agree with this statement . But I have to say that it only seems that . I have twenty years old , so I 'm young , and then I 'm part of young people . Since my point of view I believe to things about this fact . At first I would want to focus on the fact that young people help , young people want to help , they want the society to ask help to them , they have the necessity of knowing that they are part of something and that this part is useful and that society needs a lot of parts , society and their communities needs every young for running a better society and that they are needed . Young people want the society to ask for them !  And that is where I want to arrive , nowadays society shows an image of the young people as if they are lazy people , as if they only want to have fun and to be with their friends . And at least , as if society does n't expect no positive reaction of them .  A lot of young people travel abroad to underdeveloped countries to help as voluntieers . The fact that is , they can be voluntieers on their own countries , they can take care of people around them , they can help in projects of beneficency in their countries , ...  But what happens ? Most of the times their own communities do n't ask them help , they do n't know they can help in their own communities and built a better society .  In conclusion , I can state that society does n't encourage young people to help and that is because young people act in these two ways : They get relaxed because they believe socitey does n't expect anything of them ; or they travel abroad , to underdeveloped countries where young people believe that they really need their help .  Since my point of view , and apart of what I have say , there are people that are responsible with their communities and have the necessity and the aim to help in their own community and also , they view their community necessities and want to help and satisfy them as far as they can do it .

The world is changed , also people are changed . Young people became more irresponsible , the world became more competitive and young people started not to care about things happening around themselves .  First of all , young people are irresponsible to what they do . Young people are not helping the communities . We ca n't say , not at all . But it is reduced compare to long ago when it was 1900s , when the revolutions were occured . At that time the leading group was university students . But these days , those age people are harming and ruin the society . Since they do n't have any difficulties such as coup de ta't , war , or revolution . They became addicted to drugs , crimes and other bad stuff . They are not responsible to what they did , especially for rich people when they make problem , they ask their parents to solve the problem . These irresposible acts by young people ruin the society more than pasts .  Secondly , the world became more competitive . Since , the unemployment goes high and competition rasies . Young people do n't have time to help their own communities , besides community services which they have to do as a school works . Young people should spend their time more in the studying to get a job or to make their business bigger . Otherwise they will be buried from the society . For example , my country during the 1970s people who graduated universities could choose company where they want to work . But these days , even from the first rank universities ca n't get a job . The percentage they get a job was 77 percent . It means it will become harder and harder . Also , the competition will be more and more .  Lastly , young people do not care about things happening around them . Young people became selfish because of the second reason . So that they became dull about other people 's harshness and hardships . So when they see old people standing in the bus when they are sitting down . They rather ignore them or pretend sleeping . Young people do n't want to involve other people 's business , especially dangerous thing . When I was watching news program , I saw an interesting news that shows the survey . The surveyer asked people that when they see perverts in a crowded subway . Most of people answered they will ignore it . They think that that 's not their business .  As time goes by , the world became harder to live . And lesser people are helping the difficulties in societies , even though the society becomes harder , I want to encourage young people to help their society . When they ask me why , I will answer that `` you will see the different . ''	KOR
I think that the following statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' because this is a very important functions .  If you have broad knowledge of many academic subject you have the possibility to have a panoramic scenary to all over situations you have in your `` hands '' . With this conoscence you will be prepared to every situations . You will have a answer for every moment of your professional live . I think that many academic subject permetted at all person to be able to take all over profession . In stead of one specific academic subject do not permetted to be able to take any professional job . In end I think that this selections is prefered for me , but this is not equals for every other person .	ITA
I do not think young people enjoy their life more then older people . I think they enjoy it in a more physical way maybe then older people . But I think older people enjoy life in a more contemplaining way . Indeed when you are young you can do sports . I love horse-riding . In order to be able to ride a horse you need strong muscles . Strenght in this specific case is associated with youth . Indeed when you are 80 years old , chances are you will not have the strength anymore to hold yourself up on a horse . I believe that the shier capacity of doing something can make one happy , just as the incapacity of doing something can make one unhappy . As a consequence when I will be 80 years old and I will not be able to ride horse anymore , that might make me unhappy . Or , I will recall the times when I sat on a horse and will tell my grand children about how wonderful I looked when I sat on a horse . Which leads me to my next point .  I am not capable of saying today that I look wonderful on a horse . I think about improovement , when I think of horse riding . On the other hand , when I will be older I will be able to contemplate all the things , I will have done physically and experienced over my life time . In my opinion that is something just older people can do . Which in my opinion is a good thing , because it shows that nature is well made . Younger people have different ways to enjoy life , in what they are able to do for example . And then their other ways they are not able to enjoy their life , because they are young . The same goes for older people . They have their way of enjoying life , like for instance contemplating their experiences over a life time . Why because they are older and they have lived for a long time and they also have the time to think about it . Just like I do not have the time to think about how I look when I ride a horse , because I am young and therefore I am thinking about improvment .  So really there is a time for everything in life . There is a time to enjoy life , as a young person and as an old person and that makes life probably fair .	FRE
Sucess and failure lies in the hand of the person andalso depends on the the dedication and effort which he gives on his particular work .  I feel that succesfull people does different things and enjoy doing doing them . These people generally dont depend on the result of the work which was done by them but they concentrate on the effort which put on it . This the best and most fascinating thing in them . When they donot try new things and work stick to one kind of work which they are habituated to do which any risks and problems the man would certainly not called as a successful person .  For example take a biologist resercher , he starts reasearch in one particular feild and conduct experiments draws hypothisis and he continues the process till he succeed . He go for expedations and also do many adventures to study the nature of a particular species and draw conclusions by observing the behaviour of differnt animals in that species . His journey would be certainly though and it also take long time to make conclusion , if his conclusion is right and matched he is succeesful in his reaserch , but he donot stop till he will reaserch on another species and his life goes on . If he is confied to one particular reserch in his life time that would be that effective as things goes on changing and the species can adapt to differnt environment so he had to succed further .  The same is the case of a bussiness manager or a owner of a bussiness . A bussiness man is succesful in the coprate world with his product and ones a lot of profit with this product , but he will not be restricted to make that particular product only he would certainly do experiments and launch new products , if the product clicks he is succeesful but if the product doesnt click still he would be succeesful and would try to make implications on that .  Another thing is succes doesnot lie in doing a routine job , everyone should experiment and do differnt things as there is a lot in the world to still learn and we can come through them . If we are not succesful in any of the experiments we did it doesnt matter to do the experiments we get through the subject and we can then finnaly have a pool of knowledge on differnt fei	TEL
I think that its much better for a person to have a specialized knowledge of a specific subject than having a broad knowledge of many academics . Because being specialized in one subjuct gets you to know more about it and to be able to discuss it easily and thoroughly without any problems , unlike having a broad knowledge of many academics because having broad knowledge leaves you on the suface of eveything not being able to dive in any subject . For example if you where in a conversation session or on a debate about something , having broad knowege would let you be able to talk for alittle bit with everbody using the thin layer of knowledge you have to discuss stuff with people , but if you are specified in one subject you may be able to get into a deep intresting conversation .  Also being specialized in one subject gives you better working opportinities than the opportunities given to broad knowledged people . Because these days institutions want specialized people that can handle complicatied isses in buisness and life , people that can be put in hard situations wich they can handle easily without panic and to problems , and talking about money wise these institutions pay alot more money for those specefied people .  Another thing is that when we talk about the career issue specialized people are always remembered and respected everywhere they go and thier names will not ever be forgeted , broad knowleged people they are not well known or at least the majority of them . For example when we try to say who is the best in chemestry of all time we have a name , or when we try to remember who is the best in maths we have names .  That does not mean that people who have broad knowlege are bad or have less experience but i think that specialized people leave thier memories on the minds of others or they leave thier finger print on the book of history .

Nowsday , some may hold opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of amny academic subjects then to specialize o = in one specific subject . however , others may hold negative opinion about it . As far as I am concerned , I do not agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .  First of all , people will not study very well if they learn many academic subjects . Because they need to spare their time on so many subjects . We all know that the more you spend on doing one thing is better than the less you spend on doing one thing . The result for you spend one hour on study is different from the result for you spend eight hours on study . If you spend more time on one subject , you wil know more about it . But if you spend time on so many subjects , you can not deeply learn about them .  Secondly , if you have one special skill , it is easier for you to find future job . Because you have specialize knowledge in one specific subject . Many companies need people who have special skill . For instance , in Canada , it is lack of people who know how to build cable . If a person has that skill , he ccan easily find a job and get higher pay .  However , people who haver broad knowledge of many academic subjects can easily find jobs , such as in the foreign companies , they require people to speak 2 or 3 languages . Tthey may can speak 2 or 3 languages , but they may not know how to write them .  It is better to have specialize in one specific subject than broad knowledge of many academic subjects . People can learn very well in one subject rather than in many subjects .	CHI
Human have created these sense of going out of home called travelling . Travelling is a very fun option for you to take . However it is not always the way you want it to be . On the one hand you have the opportuniy to travel in a group with a tour guide or in a group but without a tour guide . With these in mind I personally prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide because you have the opportunity to learn more and also because you have your schedule done .  The first reason I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide is because I can learn better the other culture . You have a guide giving you and telling you lots of information about the new place you are visting . For instance if you decide to travel to South Africa you would not only understand even a word but also would not learn anything about these new country completely different from yours .  The other reason I prefer travelling with a tour guide is because the schedule is already program by my tour guide . I would not have any minute to waist time . I would take advantage of it in every single opportunity . In fact If you travelled without a tour guide you may not be able to wake up at seven in the morning . A few years ago I went to Cuzco in Peru and I did not contacted a tour guide . I did not learn anything about that incredible monument , you can not imagine how I regret it now . It was a waste of time traveling there without a tour guide .  Therefore whether you chose to travel in a group or by yourself try to be led by a tour guide and try always to prepared your trip very carefully in order for you to enjoy it .	SPA
I absolutely agree with the statement that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for then to learn facts . The only informations from school that never left a person 's mind is the datas that he understood clearly . About 14 years after I graduated from university , it is interresting and curious to see how I can explain most of my knowlegde to my son . Most of those information were very well understood not just memorized .  After a couple years , even if a person have a good memory , he wo n't keep in mind the concept and knowlegde that he never understands . I learned when I was a child a lot of verses on the bible , because my kid 's school had learned me those verses . But now , because I do not repeat then all the time , I forgot a lot of then . I di n't care to understand them , just learn then to have good grade . But now , now all I can remember are verses that they explained to me and those wich have a importance in my life .  I think education today should focus more on explain things insteed of just let student learn then . Our world will be better .	FRE
The following essay deals with the question , wheater it is useful to have a broad knowledge or a smaller specific knowledge of many academic subjects or not .  Firstly , it is obvious that there is no general answer for this question , because our modern world of work is too diverse for that . A wide knowledge of academic topics is needed for repsonsible jobs such as politicans or higher managers . In some situtations they do not have a lot of time to decide what would be right or wrong . In such cases they have to know things clearly and precisely to avoid a wrong decisions .  Another point is the educational sector of work . People who work in this category have to know the majority of their subject and very detailed as well . Proffessors or just a regular teacher have the duty to have a broad knowledge , because they must answer questions immediatly and precise .  Other jobs may not require a huge knowledge on academic subjects , because there are jobs , which need a vast background of knowing all details and all information existened on one specific issue . People working in labs do not need to know all about chemistry , when they do repatative work such as reproduce specific drugs .  Therefore easy or repatative work does not own the necessity to have wide knowledge .  In conclusion it is necessary to distinguish between the huge differences of our modern jobworld . As I mentioned before , it is not possible to give an overall answer on this topic and it is useful to examine every case seperately .	GER
I am disagreeing with this statement . According to my own personal experience I think that specializing on one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . I am an electronics engineer and the electronics is a very broad subject you can not learn everything on every subject  First of all if you can not pick a subject than in the future time there can be some instabilities on your knowledge because you are not focused on one subject , the knowedge you have from other subjects can misguide you in one specific thing . But if you are specialized in one subject than you know all the basics and important parts of that subject and you become the person that is required for that specific topic at everywhere you go . As an example , my major is Robotics and Control so I am very experienced in that topic and when there is a problem with control systems in the factory , I can easily go and understand the problem and provide a solution as fast as possible . But if I was not specialized in any topic , than I would have to analyze the problem , do some research to increase my knowledge at the same time trying to get over with the confusion in my mind from the knowledge of other topics in my head and than try to solve the problem . This will take longer time and I guess it wo n't be that effective . Most of the companies today are based on time effectiveness and they ca n't wait for you to increase your knowledge for the job that assigned to you .  Secondly , when you have broad knowledge of many academic subject , it is harder for you to show your eligence to the people such as they will ask you like what is your area of specializition and if you say I have a broad knowledge on many subjects most probably they wo n't accept you because today the team work is the key point to the success , nobody needs a person that say I have a very broad knowledge , I can do everything required on my own , I do n't need somebody else . You can not compete yourself with a team with mix of specialized knowledges about the topics that are related to them .  In brief , I think it is important to specialize in one specific topic . By this you can work in any team and with the mix of this specialized knowledges the team work is the best way to provide solutions to the problems . Today at every company the teams are providing solutions and conducting researches and nobody on his own can provide much .	TUR
`` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ''  Traveling is really important to my life . Traveling can show us a lot of things and make us learn about a lot of cultures . Traveling in a group can certainly make the trip fun and nicer . In my opinion , a group does not need a guide to help him . Discovering and taking risks , in a group , of getting lost is fun and is an unforgotten memory .  Traveling in a group is always part of my vacations . Last summer for exemple , i traveled with my friends to Spain to discover the country and to get to see a new culture . There when we arrived , we did n't have any guide . So we taked a taxi , gave him the adress of the hotel and he dopped us in the right place . After we deposited our bags in our rooms , and talked to one of the employee , we went to the resterants he talked us about and had so much fun . On our waybak , we got lost in the city and could n't find the hotel . After three hours of walking and the help of the others , we arrived to the hotel and sleeped .  What is interesting , is , when i talk to my friends about how we got lost and how scared we were , they laugh and they dream if these days can come back .  So we can think that traveling in a group with no guide and getting lost , is an entertaining part of the trip .  Another reason why people does n't need a guide anymore . Because of the internet and the easy way to know the places where we want to go . When my family organise a trip to a country or anywhere , they take and do everything on the internet , including the addresses . Also with the flourishment of the technology , we have the GPS that can locate our places if we are lost .  In the end , traveling with a guide is not necessarly the best way to travel . There is a lot of other ways that can be enjoyed .	FRE
I am completely positive about the statement . Here i would like to mention some reasons why a group travel is the best way to travel . I work for a travel company as a tour guide , so i guess i confirm advantages of group travelling .  First of all , tourists feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide , who is a local resident of the site . Group travelling people can defend themselves in time difficult times and it is more likely to acttract public attention for requesting for help . In some places , it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of high velocity rate .  Second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel cost . Needless to say , it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain countries . Even a number of tour companies offer special programmes for group tourists , not only discounts , but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or certain amount of members . The third reason serves our company 's main goal , More people , more fun . It is much interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation . Group tourists can attend different competitions , matches and other attractive entertainment .  Travelling is not only the meaning of to travel , but to make friends and to get relationship with them . It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way . I know of many occasions that tourists get marry after a long , exciting tour .  in conclusion , i have a strong point of view of travelling as a group . Tourists feel more secure , more respect and guides feel more responsibility when they are travelling as a group .	TUR
The society we live in is based on consumption . I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . In the contrary , nobody would buy these products .  I think that nowadays , people really need to be sure of what they buy . They want to make sure that they buy the best product . So , the only way to ensure them is to create the advertisement they want to see , even if it is not true . It is the case , for example , for the solutions which make you lose weight in only two weeks . Most of the women know it is not true but as the advertisement shows faked benefits of the solution , women want to try it , and so , they buy the product . Women finally notice that the product does not work .  It is also the case for the children . They often see toys they have ever dreamed of on television . The advertisement makes them believe that with this toy they will be the strongest , or they will be the best . As children still ignoring the principle of this consumption society , they believe what they see and they want to buy the toy . But once they have got it , they become aware of the truth and see that their toy will never give them what they were told .  So I think that , indeed , most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are . It is one of the most impostant rule of the consumption society . Produces have to always seem better than what they really are . People only buy what they think to be the best for them .  All advertisements have to lie because if they do not , the advertisement for another product would and so , the true advertisement will not have success . It seems that there is a tendancy nowadays , people prefer to be told lies to feel more confidant than being aware of the truth . That is why I think that only the advertisements whicg make product looking better than they really are are more succesfull .	FRE
Generally people which are remebered are those who leave a trace of their life in history . Nobody remembers or notice a person whose life has been carried out in an anonimous pattern . We notice what stems out from daylife , something exceptional , new . The key for success is risk . Oscar Wilde used to say that an idea which is not risky can not be considered as an idea . To give evidence to this statement we are going to outline some main points and then summarize with conclusions and caveats .  First of all , nowadays we consider successful people who occupy certain social positions due to their efforts in seeking their place . This successful social position varies depending on cultures . Nevertheless , this position is regarded as successful when the position itself is exceptional . Nobody would consider successful someone who works in a normal or standard position . This means that success depends on extraordinary situations carried out in particular conditions : it is finding a new solution , a new idea to obtain something .  Secondly , people will recognise success only when it is visible . If nothing could lead us to distinguish something from normality , we would not be able to determine the difference between the two . We will not be thus capable of recognising the new into the normal . Hence this will not be differentiable . Success is also difference , uniqueness . In other words new things .  Third , stated that success is based on difference and new ideas , it is also to be said that news find their root in risk . Elaborating something new , it is not possible to understand whether it will be regarded as something really new and meet the taste of the others or will just fail to communicate its difference . This uncertainty has to deal with risk . To be noticed as different one idea has to be new , thus risky .  To conclude , we demostrated that success comes from difference from normality ; exceptionality and risk . The last factor is perhaps the essential key for success . As Oscar Wilde said .	ITA
There are young people and older people who were enjoying their life . People who are young , they can go to school and learn subjects and skills that is fun and importance to do . and they can make school friends ( classmates ) they can play or eating lunch together . So Young people can go to school . they can do any you want . If they graduated university , they can have a job .  But older people were difficult to find jobs , so they ca n't do job anything they want . for example if old person who wants to work at slary , but this job have a limit of ages . or if old person take sporty job , like deliver to things . Older people not have enough power than younger people . But older people can living peacefuly , and young people have to working hard and they have no enough to spent time to reading novels at home , or watching TV . But older people can do .  My grandmother is doing house jobs . She often goes to shopping and she likes to cook at home . She living peacefuly and enjoying her life . But sometimes she thinks it 's boring because , it 's like she doing same thing every day . So , she saids that if she change to young people she can do jobs in actively . I thought it 's agree to her opinion .  One day I ask to grandmother to go Germanycome and enjoy with me. but she said she does n't want to go , because maybe she going to be very tired and she doe n't have power to go German . So , I decide to go many overseas when I was on young age .	JPN
As the economy and travelling ablities growing rapidly , more and more people are addicted in travelling worldwide or natiionwide . Commonly , there are two ways of enjoying our tour , one is travel by ourselves with a tour guide , the other one is joining a group and to be led by a tour guide . In my opinion , I wil definitely choose travel alone to taste my tour .  At first place , why is the travelling so facsinating ? The extoic culture , history , art , architecture , all these are attracing people to step out their own home and get involved in the fantastic amusement of the tour . How can I imaging get to our determinal with alot of people and scheduled by the tourguide ? How can I touch the soul of the other forms of humanbeing 's culture with only a few days of even only a few minutes ? So , I think making a precise schedule and get through the backgroud before tthe tour and stay there for a couple of weeks until we slightly get in touch with the spirit of the goal place , after that i will no t feel regret to spend the time of enjoying my visit .  Admittedly , there are several advantges of visit with a group and a tour guide . Like , I wil not worry about house renting with a low payment ; I will not need to check out the backgroud of the places 's virtues , rituals . history and culture , the tour guide will speak clearly to us . However , I have to pay the tour guide and the company a plenty of money , even if we know its not worth it , just because of our laziness . I can get through the visiting places 's information online , I can communicate with the house owner for renting , also I can bargan with the host , and from my prospensity , these are also the part of enjoyment of the tour . So , In a word , I can have more fun if i arrange the tourment with my self .  In addition , I like to travel with my lover together , so for this reason i will not choose go with a group beceause of lacking private time and space .  From the arguemnt discussed above , I hold the negative attitude towrds that the best way to travel is on a group led by atour guide , just for the reasons sta	CHI
Always is better to understand facts .  As student , I really think it it easer for us to understand a topic by using examples and learning facts . When students just see the concept in class or the definition about something it 's dificult to them to rebemeber it just as they saw it in class , but if they see an specifically case about the same concept it will be easier to keep it in mind , because they can relate it to the real life .  For example , last semester in my human reasources class I had a teacher that always helped us to relate the theory with the practice , I remember one class where we saw what an interview was and in what consisted , and she took a classmate to make him an interview explaning all the steps we need it to do to make it right , and showing the most common mistakes that we could commit .  I remind it was so enriched for everybody in class , and after that when I entered to my fist job , I could rememeber everything I had learned and I took it to the reality .  When we learn facts it also helps us to convey it with our own experiences .  On the other hand , I have had classes where we get full of concepts and definitions of some subjects but we really do n't know how to put it in practice and I do think all this information goes away .  In conclusion , to learn in a classroom or out of it will be always better to usderstand facts and to related with reality , and also it will be easier for us to explain and to teach somebody else , because we have already absorbed this infomation , and proffesors should do this with the students since they are kids to provide them an important tool to learn better .

The world and sociaty change every day , because the develope of techknowleges . People get imformation faster and faster , the world become smaller and many things get relationship with others . So , the sociaty needs the elits are complemently , people have to know more than one things of a specific subject , they should have broad konwledge of many academic subjects .  Study wildly can make peolpe learning many differents ways to solve differents problems . They make people have wildly sight . The differents course have dierents logic to sovel problems . For example the Geometry , that is solve problems usually use the diogragh , lines and curves . The Data course use logically way to thought about a question . So , whem people have the problem , they can think about it and sovle it in dierents ways .  To have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make people feel confidence . The can know many things in differents area . They can have the topic and idea to talk to other people . Just like a student on the party if he/she learn broad he/she can communication with other people who study other major . If the person just study one specofic subject , that is hard to find topic can comunicated with other people , then keep silence in the corner . The people will miss confidence .  In conclution , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subects than to specoalize in one specific subject . It can make people ' knowledge and viewsight wildly , aslo can make people feel more confidence becuase he/she knows many things in the dierents area . That is good for the persent sociaty .	CHI
I think a basic knowledge is necessary , but in my oppinion our society needs more people who are familliar with one specific subject . Having broad knowlege does not necessarily helps you to solve a specific problem . In my home country for example , there are many people who can handle a computer , but there are only a few who have enough knowledge to deal with certain problems on their own . That 's one reason why many computerfirms hirer people from countries like India . This situation is not so good for our inhabitants , because often they do not get a job .  This is only one example for why specialization has advantages for the economy of a country . There is no doubt on that employees need a broad knowledge to be flexible , if they for example lose their job , which is a great problem in our country . But I think , if there are experts for almost every area , a country 's economy has many advantages , altough it is very risky for the inhabitants to specialize , because they may get no job in their specific academic subject .  But as I said , there are many advantages which support the idea of specialize in one specific area . But it shoulb be regarded what size and capacity the firm has . A big company has many employees and so each employee can handle a problem on his own . If he need to know anything about an other subject he can ask an other expert for help . So with the help of teamwork they can nearly solve every problem . In smaller businesses this looks a bit different , because small firms can not afford so many employees . So for smaller businesses it is better to have a broad knowledge , so that you can solve many different problems .	GER
I agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are two reasons for this : more active than olders and having experienceis .  First of all , young people is more active than olders . Therefore , they have so many energy to do everithing . For example , body condition is quite defferent between young poople and old people . When Our family trisd to hike the Mt . Fuji which is the most biggest mountain in Japan . SIster and I could get to the top . Hoeever , my parents could not do that . Moreover , obiously young people 's body function is better than olders . If the have examine of body , the result is easy to expect . Thus , young people have to enjoy their life .  Second of all , young people need having a lot of experiencies . They are young so much . Their experiencies are naturally poor . Older people already had experienced a lot of thing . and , they steped to be an adult which means that they can decide things themselves .  In conclusion , I support that young people enjoy life more than older people do . If they enjoyed their life , they will be a good person .	JPN
Nowadays there is a discussion about the youngsters . It is that recently , do young people give enough time to helping their comunities ? In my opinion , young people do not give enough time to helping to their communities , as it was at past . At our time , there are lots of things that youngsters can waste their time with .  Firstly , most of the young people are wasting time with computers . Computers were made for people 's goods at first but then it starts to become a toy or a game machine and no one tried to stop it , because games are a seriously large echonomic resource for the people working in this sector . For example , young people can try using computer and internet for searching for the informations about their country 's place in the world and feature predictions about their country . Further more this interest would make the young people more interested in their communities .  Secondly , I think that younng people are not taking the lessons at their schools so seriously . There are important lessons given to the student at school about their communities like history and geography . In my opinion , every person , related to a community , should know his country 's history . Also geography is an important factor for a person to help his/her community . These are just two factors for a person to help his/her community that the educations of them are given at school . Moreover school gives the education of loving your country , after your family . These are all well known by people , but , however , still people are not taking seriously and thinking schools as gamefields .  Young people are like diamonds . You should shape them , otherwise you can not expect anything from them . They have to be shaped , if they are wanted to be the savers of the community . So if a youngster does n't give enough time to help his/her community , it is also his/her family 's fault .	TUR
Do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? perhaps it is diffecult to answer because every one of them have their method to enjoy their own life . But in my opinion , old people enjoy life more than young ones because of several reasons so I disagree with this statement .  First , old people have a long experience in life so they know exactly how they enjoy . In contrast , young people do't have enough experiences .  For an example , mybe an young person tried to enjoy by something which is harmful but he did n't know , and after some time he enjured him self . But an old one may have an experience with that thing so he will not try it again .  Second , even though that young persons have a lot of choises to enjoy but in the sane time they have several things to worry about . For example , their jobs , their business , their family , their healthy and other things that the life now required to worry about .  On the other hand , old persons do n't have any thing to worry about except thei healthy .  For example , young person go to the gym to enjoy and whil he excersices he remember something that make him go out from the gym and lose that enjoy time . But the old one will not care about any other thing than his enjoy and his health .  finally , every one has his own enjoyable .	ARA
I am not agree with this idea alwase . beacause I woud like to travel with my family and my car . When you travel with your family such as your wife , you can have a very god sex relationship with her during the travel . and when your children are with you , it will be a very intresting travel . when you travel with your car , you can rest at any work that you like . you can sleep and bee have your specific relationship with your howse and your children .  In the other hand , ther are many travels that the best way to do it , is in a group led by a tour guide . because when you travel in a group , it is a unique apportunity to familiar with new peoples and use from the guide of a leader is very usfull and intresting . Also , when you travel in a group , maby you fond some new good friends , such as girl friends and etc .  Travel is very god , but unfortunatly we cant to do it in our coutry because of mony problem . we have so mony problems that only we think for `` night bread .

I totally agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are . I have three reasons to explain this .  First , the aim of the advertisment is to sale more products . No producer wants to decrease the functions of the products in the adversitiment . On the contray , the producer will try their best to show the positive aspects of the products and minimize the negative aspects . So , the products in the advertisement will only have the advantages . For example , the advertisement of the medicine will only tell the customs which disease it can curve and neglect the serious point of the medicine . Some customs will be extra-damaged by the medicine for the negative aspects of the medicine .  Second , in order to sale more products , the producers enlarge the functions of the products in the advertisements . The products in the advertisement will be much better . For example , the mineralized water are good to the health of human body . Some producer take the mineralized water as penecean which can be used as medicine to some illness .  Third , the advertisement is a goods too . The advertiser can sale it only when it can satisfied the producer of the products . That means the advertiser need to make sure the product in the advertisement should be excellent , even better than it actually it .  From the above , we can draw a conclusion that the products in most advertisements are not the same as themselves . Their funcitions are been enlarge in the advertisement . So , the goverment should care about this problem to let the custom know the truth of the products .	CHI
In my opinion , older people enjoy life more than young people .  `` Enjoy oursleves and have all the fun we could have . '' Is what most young people thinking of . They spend time to do sports , to date with people , tend to clubs and pubs to find their fun ; drink and smoke to make themselves feel more high , more excited . It 's not a healthy life , and not a responesble life also . When people are young , mostly they spending money given by their parents , instead of spending money earned by themselves .  And , secondly , young people always tend to be selfish and takeing less care about others . They do n't actually know how important other people rolling in their life . In that case , they will do less contribution to the either farmily or community . So , in my view , young people do not know `` how '' to enjoy life .  In contrast , old people , on the other hand , think otherwise . '' Enjoy ourselves with other people , have fun while we can . '' Is what they think . They are more matural and know what they are supposed to do . Old people usually go travel when they have free time and extra financial abilities . They go to clubs too for different purpose , have a drink with friends or old classmates . Most of them know how to lead a life which is healthy and full of happiness .  Also , old people know how to make themsleves helpful and valuble to others . They know hwo to share happiness with other people . Especially when they had their children . They enjoy a real `` life '' .  In all , old people know how to enjoy the life and they are enjoying more than young	CHI
Responsiblity plays a big role in our life spicifically for older people . when an young child is having fun and he doe n't care about money , home and issues that happens for any person . Young poeple think that they still have a good health but when they get older their health will start to go down . I agree with young people who want to have fun more than older people for couple reasons .  First of all , responsiblity as I mentioned in the beginning , makes any person thinking about how to make his life more confident and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything he wanted to do . For example in any family , the father always think about how to get money for his children , the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially . If we look at the children , we can notice that they want to play everyday and have fun without thinking about anything . That was a good example of showing the difference of how young and old people act .  Second reason , old people always start to take care of their health which absoultly goes down as they get older . In the other hand , young people think about no resposibilty and no problems with their health , so why do n't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future . For example , if someone who is 60 years old and he is retired from his job , he could have health problems refuses him to enjoy his life . Another man who is 20 years old , who just finished his high school and he wants to play sports and going out with his friends without any health problems thats if we ignore the exceptinals like the handicaps .  Finally , i agree with young people to have fun with their life before they get older because they will have more responsibilties more than before . Also , no body knows about his health and how good its going to be . I hope everyone enjoys his life whether he is olde or young .	ARA
I disagree that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . Because , even if they are very busy doing other things , they still find time to help other people . For instance , there are many things that young people colud do to help their neighborhood people , such as taking care af ill people , or old people , or even help kids after school .  For instance , when I was attending high-school , my friends and I worked for the `` red cross '' , which consist of taking care of ill people . It was such a special experience for me , because I could stay in contact with people who really needed me , and it was a pleasure to be able to help them . I did not do a great job , i just gave them attention , I spent time talking with them , and even if it can seems a little , for them it was a lot .  Furthermore , I usually like spending time with my next-door neighbor , she is a very old woman , she is often alone . So sometimes , my boyfriend and I spend some time with her . For instance , it can happen that she needs something , and we usually go to the shop for her . So someway , I try to help her , even if I do not have a lot of time , but she always appreciates it .  Besides , an other way to help people can be looking after kids . When I was in high-school , I also usually look after some kids during the afternoon , at my chearch . The parents of these kids were always working during the afternoon , so they used to stay with me and other gyus . We usually helped them with their homework , or we played some games .  In the end , I can say that from my experiences , young people give a lot of time helping other , even if live is always more frantic . They take care o	ITA
in the world there are people with different behaviour , traditions and ways of think . Moreover there are people more or less rich and the statement young people enjoy life more than older people is not always true above all for the african , asian and south american people where young people are like older people because they are in a difficult situation and they must work . I live in Italy and I see that in Europe the situation is different because youg people have parets with a secure work so boys like me can live a beutiful life while older people like my parents can work for me . I think that older people live in different ways respect youg people so they enjoy life in other things .	ITA
It all dependswath enjoy life means for people , live or live in excess , as much the better . I belive that young people enjoy life if that is go to parks or beaches and practice extreme and dificult sports . Young people can stay late at night , drinking or dancing but the also can wake up early in the morning and go to work . They do n't have limits in how much risk and danger they take . Much young people receive economic support from their parents and that give them more time to enjoy . Parents always try to give their kids the life style they never enjoy . The society and the process of evolution in technology give also an advance to joung people for experience new ways of enjoy life . Young people do n't focus to much in the future , they just want life and enjoy the present .  In the other hand is the old people who is feeling the weight of life in their body . Even if they take care well of their body , older people ca n't practice sports or social life from long periods of time . Somentimes thats not really important because everything in excess is bad . Older people see life from other pont of view . They do the same than joung people but not in the same intensity . They discover the beauty of life and develop the quality of look for the detail . The detail give you the hability to recognize when someone or somenthing is special . seeing the quality versus quantity when you give or receive is an art that need to be cultivate . The precious reality in this situation is that everyone is going to experience at some point of their life both sides of the human nature . I am a 37 years old male with a latin tradition . I love my LORD JESUS and believe that at this point of my life , I stay with the old people . I prefer quality versus quantity .	SPA
Everybody can notice that nowadays the mass media is the most powerful thing that can leave a massive influence on us special on taneegers & children . actually i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are & that is because of tow reasons .  The first reason is they do all the advertising about something in a wonderfull way that show you it is the best thing for you & you cant live without it . Then , you discover all these advertising for nothing really worth it . For example : once i watched on T.V an advertising about a straightner for the hair to make it straigh so they made that in a way that all the people will thought its really cool & you will have healthy hair , next i bought it & guess what ?? It was really bad , it destroyed & burned my hair . Another example : my boyfriend was walking in the street & he saw posters about a rain-party , you can see from the posters that everything will be included the ticket but when he reached there everything in the poster was a lie .  The second reason , there is no sencor for the advertisements special on the internet , which that make alot of companies & shops do whatever they want & laughed at people . once i met a friend she was really angry so i asked her whats going on ?? She told me that she pooked adress throught the internet & she paid for it but when she went there to take it they told her that she have to pay more because she didnt come at the same day .  In short , we must take-care of these kinds of advertisements , also you have to be sure with who you are dealing . In my opinion the goverment should put sencor on the all advertisements in the mass media . At the end dont forget to watch out & to think in a critical way when you communicate with these stuff .

Business meaning of advertisement is to show what you are not . So I completely agree with the fact that advertisements tell speak ` bad ' products ` good ' . Mostly advertisements talk about the bad products .  Today advertisements are everywhere . Turn on your idiot box , it will show you advertisements mainly with certain gaps which are called programs . You turn on your PC , cross a busy road , or do whatever ; you can not get rid of an ad . Now comes the business aspect . Why there is need of so many advertisements ? Two words have the answer . ` Purchase ' and ` profit ' . All advertisement are the brainchild of some unsuccessful products which the creator want to make it successful .  So why one person needs to advertise his product ? To make it famous ? Yes maybe but the most dominant reason is to sell and to make profit . Why you need an ad if your product is so good ? I witnessed the same situation when I was young . I loved one chocolate of a particular brand . I never saw its ' advertisement in TV or in any journal . Now suddenly oneday I saw its ad which told me that it has changed . Joyfully I went to a shop , I bought one , only to discover that price had increased and the cover pack became more glossy . Thats the magic of an ad , when the product is right you dont need to advertise it .  Advertisements are very lucrative because of its ` free ' offer . I have seen thousands gather in front of malls to get a free offer with a particular product . So what is the motive of the free offer ? Nothings comes for free . Free is the word that is seen by all , we need to see some invisible information such as decrese in quality in place of free . Once my mom bought vegetable oil after seeing a wonderful new ad of the reduced price product . Later she discovered that the expiary date is already over .  In some cases what an ad tells are completely lie . Our favourite actors and actresses dont bath with that particular soap which they advertise . These are just to promote sell .  I mostly got worst products whenever I was prompted by an advertisement , so my suggestion is ' do n't be fooled by any advertisement ' .	HIN
In that essay I am going to tell if I agree to the question or not . I kind of idea states that it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , other idea states that learning facts is more beneficial . I support the idea of this question . It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Because , in order to find something new a student should learn the basic concepts and ideas . Learning facts is a part of the working . It is more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts . In the academic world , in universities we are told that learning concepts and ideas are more important because by learning that you can learn the facts and you can make the facts more efficient for humanity .  Suppose an electrical engineering student wants to make an innovation about the transistor concepts . Transistor is a kind of device that is used in all electronic devices . When that student wants to learn the facts , without knowing the ideas and concepts he can not be an engineer . An engineer should be innovative , should think about something new . In order to invent something the concepts and the ideas should be understood . In order to learn the facts , a student should know the ideas and concepts , without knowing the concepts and ideas the student can not invent anything . He could be a electric technician .  Think about communication area . 15 years ago mobile phones are not worldwide used . However , in that days everybody uses celular phones . Technology becomes more efficient by time . If the engineers and students just learn the facts , without knowing the ideas and concepts it will be impossible for them to increase the technology level . By understanding the concepts they are sharing the information and technology can be used in a better way .  In conclusion I want to restate that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts . If a student wants to introduce something new he should know the ideas and concepts . If he just learn the facts in my opinion he can not introduce something new . Thats the way that the academic learning is taught on universities . They tell by using ideas and concepts to way of learning . By these , we can learn facts but if just facts are taught there will be no way to increase the humanity level or technology there should be different opinions .	TUR
Young people are energetic and driven , so they have a responsibility to use their talents meaningfully . It is expected that they be enthusiastic about giving back to the community that raised them .  But what actions constitute `` helping '' our community ? Voluntary work at non-profit organizations seems to be the easiest answer . Small acts of kindness - like helping a senior citizen cross the road - are often cited as ways for young people to serve the community . I believe that any work - paid or unpaid - done for the right intentions should count as helping our community .  Having said that , I think that the amount of time young people nowadays devote to their communities is regrettably lacking . I personally know a few young people who have never done an hour of voluntary work in their lives . Not only are they uninterested in the welfare of their fellow citizens , neither do they see any point in serving their own family members or friends . Since they fail to see beyond themselves , there is no hope that they will give any time to help the community at large .  Most educated young people have a vague sense of responsibility involving their communities , but there are so many distractions that prevent them from devoting time to it . Peer pressure , new technology , the mass media and pop culture simply teach them all to concentrate on themselves and try to live a happy , materialistic life . It is a pity , since so many young people are lead away from exercising their civic responsibility . No matter how much they are told by parents to help their community , it is impractical if there are so many distractions in their lives .  Many young people do a small part in helping the community by doing community service . However , performance is n't satisfactory either . Even if they are doing voluntary work for no monetary pay , many young people are inevitably waiting for payment in some other form - points for an academic scheme , an impressive mention in their resume , or an award for `` outstanding service '' . If they are intent on these superficial rewards , what follows is that the extent of their help will not be proportionate . Moreover , what little heart they have for service will diminish quickly , and of course this is definitely not `` enough '' .  In some situations , it is certainly understandable that young people choose other activities over service . Students should put their studies on high priorities , and young people in general seek excitement and new experiences , so they are entitled to some level of self-centeredness . In fact , pursuing wild , creative ways of doing things will probably be a help to community , if these young people choose to lend their talents and innovations accordingly . This requires a much deeper understanding than exists in the young people of today , but it also goes to show that the measure of contribution is hardly as simple as time - it involves an awareness and some heart in all of us .

Who enjoys life more , young people or older people ? In my opinion , I tend to say that older people enjoy life more . First of all , older people have much more leisure time than young people . As older people have already worked for a long time , they need not work so hard as young people . They need not struggle so hard for survival as young people do . As a result , older people have more leisure than yound people . With more leisure time , older people can travel , can have holidays with their families , and can do other activies . Imagine what young people are doing when older people are enjoying their life . Students at universites may be busy with writing their assigments , cramming for exams . Those who have jobs may be doing extra work in the office . How miserable they are !  Secondly , older people have more money compared with young people , making them lead more comfortable life . As older people have worked longer time than young people , they earn more money and have more savings , which can make them afford long distance travel to Paris , to Rome , or even to space , depending their financial ability . However , young people can only enjoy the short trip and some hikings . Though no one can deny the interest that short trip and hikings can bring , they can not be comparable to those brought by the the romantic travel abroad .  Thirdly , older people can manage their life better than those young people due to their longer living and social experiences . Older people know what is most important to them . They know that enjoyment of life , instead of making money or working is more important to them . They know the value of being together with their family members , so they try their best to accompany their wife or husband . On the contrary , according to my knowledge , most young people do not realize what is important to them . They make every possible effort to make money and grasp every chance to get promoted in their working place , neglecting the happiness of being accompanied and accompanying their family members .  In conclusion , I think that older people enjoy life more because they have more time , more money , and they can manage their life more efi .	CHI
Young people nowadays often live in a society where education and work becomes a more and more difficult task due to high competition . Today 's young people also live in a modern world with much more accessible distractions than before .  On the one hand , I think the society we live in has become highly competitive in all aspects . Since good education is becoming more and more accessible , universities , companies now require an even higher level of education . In my opinion , that is why some people now work harder than before .  On the other hand , the invention of computers , video games , and all the other different accesories made the young people of today much busier .  These reasons are why I agree with this statement in most cases . I think that young people nowadays simply do n't have the time to help their communities . I also think that these young people are not to blame , modern society is .  If I talk about my personal experience , I can say that I do not give enough time to helping my community . One of the reasons why I do n't is because nobody encourages me to do it . People around me are becoming less and less aware of the problems in their communities and are becoming more selfish .  I think it is also important to say that it is not 100 % true that all young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . I think it applies more to rich and weathy countries . In the third world countries , I think people are more aware of poverty and as a result are less distracted by all the new technologies .	FRE
In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do . There are several reasons to explain my opinion .  Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities . They have more freedoom . They must go to school , do their homeworks and clean their rooms . But they have a lot of free time . They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun . They can meet many other friends to have fun together .  Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themself . They spend most of time at work . They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening . Old people are more mature than young people because they had many experencies during their life .  In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do . To be a young people is beautiful . If you were a children , you could do what you prefer without problems . A children thinks nothing about serious events or facts . Old people are under stress or serious . Young people are always happy . Young people can enjoy life more then older people because they cant look at bad things or facts but only at good , pleaseant and beutiful things and events .	ITA
I both agree and disagree this statement .  On one hand , a broad knowledge of academic subjects is often , dare I say always , good to have . It is important for man to have a knowledge of many field as possible . You as human being always want to learn more and , in University for instance , one subject is not enough all .  I am currently a student . I study at la Sorbonne Nouvelle University which is the top university for foreign languages . I am majoring in both English and German but there are many other languages you can learn such as Spanish , Italian but also Arabic , Chinese or Hindi . After graduating from this university and this major , students often applied for jobs in commercial trade or International Business . In this context , the knowledge of many academic subjects is much more than useful . In the case of two graduate students applying for the same job in International Business , somehow I know that the one who has the knowledge of different foreign languages will get the post . My university is also famous for cinema , dramatic art , and communication and it is absolutely possible to major for example both in Foreign languages and in Cinema or follow theater classes .  But on the other hand , I think that there is a time when students have to focus on what they really want to do and what the really want to be and then , according to it , try to get more chances as possible in order to sucess . For example , the knowledge of many academic subjects could lead students into confusion . they try to learn as many subjects often because they are interested in all sorts of fields and if you ask these students what they prefer for most or what they would rather study if they would only have to chose one academic subject , they do not know . This fact can explain why a lot of students fail their first years of college . Most of university failures in France are cause of a mistake in the choice of majors which are cause of a bad information after the twelvth grade .  I would say as a conclusion that it is always interesting to have a knowledge in as many field as possible but students have to focus on the main point which is success .	FRE
I agree . Because if I had many academic subjects , I can become some professoinal . Because I want to be a business man , I need to know many subject . But I do n't know about business yet . So I think I should learn about academic subjects . If I learn specialize in one apecific subject , It is a little place where I will work . Because , I have only one soecific subject . So maybe I can not communicate with some partner of other country . In conclusion , I agree about this question .	JPN
I do agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and with good purpose . The main focus of advertisements is to make it seem that the product is the best thing in the world , that it is completely necessary and the most important of all , to sell the product to make profits which equals money . A good example of these reasons are : diet pill campaings and ads on television . They make ordinarily difficult goals to obtain , obtainable making it seem easy , fast and without breaking a sweat . First of all , they target the one thing humans are concerned about : their psychical beauty specifically lossing , gaining weight or being healthy . Todays men and women understand the importance of having a healthy body and being in shape for different reasons these being : health related issues such as heart disease , diabetes , morbid obesity , etc . .. and other more psychical reasons are : the stereotypes of being pretty and skinny in a judgemental society that trives on superficial beauty . Healthy bodies and weight loss come from : healthy eating habits , exercise and well organized planning . Diet pills advertisements make it seem as if you could skip all of these steps and still achieve your goal of a healthy shape and body , which in irony is not healthy or recommended by doctors because the risks are endless . Still people buy these products because they want to be the lovely young lady with the tight body or men want to be that guy with the washboard abs to feel good psychically and mentally . To understand how this operates we must look for the obvious reasons of why the product would seem much better . First of all , the image of expressing the easily unobtainable as obtainable is key in selling the product and therefore making more money and secondly when watching a television ad look for the little black paragraphs in which the truth about the product is stated and they do n't want you to know quickly . This is n't a new practice every product will seem the best to make a profit out of it , but it is up to us to be educated and be informed about the product we hear or read about to make a wise decision when purchasing it .

I agree with the statement that says young people enjoy life more than older people do . It is because young people tend do to be optimistic towards life whereas older people tend to be realistic . I am 21 years old now and I consider myself young , and I think I can do anything I want in my life . It sounds more enjoyable and exciting when people thing that they can do everthing . However , the older you become , the tougher the life becomes , so older people tend to forget how to dream and enjoy life itself . It is probably because of these things : money , family and health .  First , when you get older , you think about money a lot . money that comes from job ca n't easily break your savings . to be an adult is to be independent somehow , so you should make a living by yourselves . but when you are young , you can live with your parents and still have a part-time job and spend it on your own . I was the richest when I was in high school , living in a house and do whatever . when you have money , you can enjoy your life more because you can do a lot of things . especially the money can spend on your own .  Next thing I want to point out is the family . Like I said in the second paragraph , when you are young and do n't have your kids yet , you can almost do anything . however , things will be different if you have kids . Your free time will be limited and you always have to think about your family and also the BILLS !! Jobs may not be the prpfable ones but you still have to work for your family . Occupation is the number one factor for an adult to be stressed , and stress can make people enojoy their life . It will be just pain in the neck .  Last but not least , as you get older , your body will not listen to you as it used to . I do n't have any disabilities or bad guts or anything right now , but if I look at my mother , she is always complaining about her health . she says she has bad legs and waist , and she doe n't like to go out often . Just sitting at home wo n't be the best thing to do but what if there is no choice ? so I think I do what I can do when I 'm still young and take advantage of being young .  In the mean time , there will be time that I can enjoy my life as older people , however , being young is just one facotor of life that onlder can not beat .	JPN
I do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people . What makes a young person happy may not make an older preson happy . To `` enjoy life '' is a very subjective concept that varies according to the age , cultural background , religious beliefs , social environment and many other factors . Form my own experience , I learn to enjoy life every day .  When I was a child I was completely unable to socialize , to relate to other children and have fun with my friends . Family problems that I was going through made me a very shy girl . In many occassions I could not find the way out from unconfortable situations . The inablity to ask for help made my childhood pretty sad .  Young people today have , sometimes , problems to express what makes them happy because of `` peer pressure '' . Most of the teenagers who are `` followers '' ( meaning not leaders ) may find themselves in awfull situations , doing and performing acts they do n't want to do . As we grow up , we dare to be deffierent . We learn to say `` no '' and do not feel bad about it . Our personalities get stronger and we feel more comfortables with who we are .  As we grow up we learn to overcome obstacles and as we get older we get wiser and learn from our own experiences and other 's experiences . The more we know about ourselves , the easier we find our way to happines . It takes time to discover and understand what makes us happy . That wisdom to understand and comprehend what joy means to us comes with age , with a life full experiences , mistakes and successes .  I strongly believe the opposite of that statement . A shy girl who does not know how to ask for help , or a teenager who feels oppressed by his or her peers and a life with no experience will certainly have a harder time to find happiness , to enjoy life . As I get older , I get wiser . When I make a mistake I learn from it . I heard a long time ago that growing older is mandatory , growing up is optional . I agree with that .	SPA
I strongly agree because I believe that if you manage to understand the main idea of an event , it will last in your mind and you will be able to remember it for a long time , and that if you just learn the facts of the events they wo n't last in your mind that much .  An example that I believe can be given is when high schools students learn about hystorical events , if they just memorize dates , names and places they will be able to remember them just in order to aply them in a test , unless it 's a super important subject of history .  But if they analize the situation , analize the events that ocurred and comprehend why did that event ocurred in the first place , they will like the subject more , they will feel a little bit smartter and the dates , the names and the places will be left in a second place , so this will even help them when they will have to memorize dates and such , because they will be able to associate the purposes and reasons of the events with the numbers and the names .  I believe that is not necessary for learning to be boring , if you just memorize everything and study just because you want to get a good grade , you are not doing the real purpose of learning , you 're just dealing with a lot of problems and getting yourself tired and bored .  Studying can be fun , if you understand everything you will feel smart , if you just learn the facts without actually understanding what they mean you will feel bad and less intelligent , so I think that teachers should encourage students to exceed themselves and to develop their intelligence and not to memorize a thousand books without understanding anything or withouth even learning things that will truly be helpful in your life .  People that are truly smart can solve a problem without the necessity of consulting someone else who 's supossed to be more intelligent , and if you need to read something a thousand times to actually get ahold of the idea you 're just a mere puppet and is pointless to live as a puppet because at the end of your life you will feel bad for having restricted your true intelligence .

We live in an age where information is exchanged between continents on the click of a mouse , where geography has ceased to define distance . What i try to mean is that with globalisation comes competition . According to me , to stay ahead in this highly competitive race one has to excel or master in whatever academic field one may be . This mastery of an academic subject can only be attained by specializing in that particular subject rather than having only a broad knowledge about various related subjects . The old cliche `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' does not appeal much to me .  I would like to elucidate my theory of specializing in a particular subject is better than having knowledge of various academic subjects by citing a practical example . Obviously a company would prefer a man with a masters degree in Chemical engineering to another man applying for the same job but with a diploma in chemical engineering and a diploma in biological engineering . Even if the company would employ the latter for his skills in both chemistry as well as biology he would definitly be given a post subordinate to that of the former & a pay package which would be lesser than the former . However if the man with the diploma would hold a degree in say a managment course and if the company would also require the managerial skills at the same time then it would be a different question all together .  To sum it up i would say that a specialized course in todays world is given a higher priority in the competitive market .	HIN
I do n't think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . I would say that they might convey that kind of illusion because they can take more benefit from the life than older people do but it does n't mean that they enjoy life more .  First of all , I would say that young people want to discover the world before all . Indeed , the older people are aware of the world which is surrounding them . They have already experienced most of the feelings a person can undergo or simply feel . The young people want absolutely to try new things , to experience other feeling .  On the other hand , they are actually younger , that 's true . So they can take profit of everything , do some very physical sports that an older person could n't do , they also are faster . Everything has to be quick , it 's because we want to discover other things .  I take part to that phenomenon , I 'm young but nevertheless I do n't think that I enjoy life more than my parents . They take profit of the life in a different way . As an example , they travel , that I ca n't do on my own because I 'm financially dependant to my parents . So I do other things , I do outings with my friends , I do as every adolescent does .  However , this speed with which we execute our activities may lead to a missunderstanding of the situation . Except the old people who ca n't do almost anything because they are too old , and the depressive persons who are n't feeling in doing activities , all the people enjoy life the same way . The reason is that we 've got only one life and it would be without interest to spend that life in doing anything .  As a conclusion , I would say that I disagree with the statement of the issue and I think t everybody enjoys the life	FRE
I agree with the idea the `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . '' For example , my mother often talks me about when she was young . She talks about the relationship between the community she lived and her . according to her story , the community provided a lot of festivals for loxcal childrens and elder people . For example , cherry blllosome festival in spring , fire works in summer . they held a moon festival in fall and the New Years Day in finter thr shrine in the community made rice cakes with the local people . every case of those the events in the community , the young local people went to help to prepare and the clean up after wards . Those experiences help the young people to knoe the local people and to build up good relationship between another people . So , many young people want to help the holding events again and help it , the circulation holding the opprtunities and the good reletionship of the community will be made up . This is a story when my mother was young .  Then , how about today ? Think about when Iwas little kid , I did not have such opportunities to join the local event so many time . Because the plase I live is kind of old and there are not so many young people to help those events . Also , actually I do not have so many familier people in my community , the relationship of our community is not so good if we compared to the one of many years ago .  Also , when I was junior high scool student , I joind such many kind of volunteer works , but I did not have so many opportunites to help my own community . As long as I emember , every time I do volunteer work , I went another community which offered to help them . I mean , nowadays , there are less opprtunities for young people to searve for community . Also the other reason I think recent young people do not help the comunity is that there no goiod relationship among the community .	JPN
Something that we have to have in main are the differents between being a young people or old people . What can you do when your are young rather that old ? This question will give you which one is better .  Night live , responsabilities and money are the differents between then .  We have to begin night live . Some young people between 15 and 20 do not even what a night live is , so if you are an adult , you can enjoy a night culb without any restrition . Other inportant point is that you do not have to tell anyone where are you or what are you doing because you a old and you do not depend of your fathers .  Also , other important point in the live of a young or old people is the responsability . If you are young you allways will have school and that is a big responsability , but if you are a old , you just will do whatever you want and you just have to worry about yourself .  The last and most importan point is the money . when you are young you have you father and they are the only ones who are worry about the economy . however , you will not have everything you want only because is not you money is their money , so if you want to bay something the do not want you just can not bay it .  in conclution , the life for the old people was , is and will be allways better and if your are young you can enjoy but not as much as you want . but you can also wait until you grow up and become a old man .

As we now that in this world every one want freedom , no one want to be a slave . Because they think that they had born individual . According to this statement i am not agree with the following statement . Because its not a need to go in a group or led by tour guide . The main purpose of tour guide is to lead the team , and show the direction . In the group or with tour guide there are lot of boundation , like we have to move with group only . we cant move as we like to move any where . we have to follow all the instruction which is given by group leader . even we like that place or not we have to be stay with them . Lots of problem we can face at the time of trevel . If we are going in a group we cant leave that place without permission . So now a days in our society no body wht restriction , they want to move free and enjoy any where . Like i am taking a example of college student , if they are going picnic for five days for the permission of college principal . There college principal suggest them better you people go with tour guide , so that in future you need not to be faced any problem . But student were not agree because they want to go without guide or any faculity member . They want only freedom , because then only they can enjoy any where and use there time in a better way . some time we need a tour guide but not every time , and also we keep in mind that up to a certain limit freedom must be there , if it will ecess it will not good for individual . In my opinion the best . Finally i would like to conclude the best way to travel without any tour guide , but we have to manage all the things , in a right manner and in a systematic way .	HIN
I quite agree with statement , that young people enjoy life more than older people do .  Being young means lot of energy . Young people have more energy than as compared to any older person . More energy help them to take part in more activies . Though this could be only true if these energies are spend towards positive activies .  When a person is young , he is always in learing stage . So many times they may come across new places and new things , they will enjoy knowing about it , because it would be their first interaction with it . E.g. simple driving , young people may find it more joyfull than older ones . Because driving would be relatively a new activity for them as compared with older ones , who could be frusted will daliy traffics and other issues related to it .  If you ask this same question to a school children during their exams , it can be expected what theirs answers could be . But during their vaction time , it may be opposite . This lets us know , how immature a humanbeing is when he is in his young ages . Immature humanbeing , mean do n't understand reponsibilites towards their life than a older person could understand . In short a young person could have less responsibilites in his life compared wiht a older person , which puts a older person to in more stressed life .  Said all these , life is great . Its better we understand our different stages of life and enjoy its each stage as it comes . Each stage of a life has its own beauty , to lead a happy life , one should understand this and should enjoy his or her life to most no matter in what age he or she is	HIN
Scholar 's main goal is to make sure their alumni have learned their teachings . Understanding ideas assures them that the student has a clear image of what was taught by portraing it into concepts . Once they have knowledge about these statements and ideas they can develop their own , expand the already made or come up with counter ideas . All of the previously mentioned force students to keep on with their mental growth . Facts are obvioulsly helpful , however that 's as much you 'll get from them . Facts will avoid learning because most you do with them is memorize and file them in a redundant folder of your brain . They 'll show up when their convinient ; ideas will stick around .  I attended a Model UN annual debate meeting in 2005 . Me and my classmates chosen to represent our school in the meeting were newcomers and needed explanation in order to fulfill expectations . We were n't clear about the process . Our highly demmandig teacher made us participate in an re-enactment of last year 's meeting and even though it took us a while to get the idea once we got the hang of it we cleared our doubs and understood the concept . Model UN is not just another extra-curricular activity it was an opportunity for sucess . We were training our minds to think for others , to speak for the ones that ca n't for themselves and to come up with resolutions to world wide problems . That is the thruthful concept of the Model UN and we knew that even before getting there . Once we got to La Ceiba , Model UN scenary , we had an ultimate learning experience .  Our instructor could of listed a serie of facts and sure it 'd help but we 'd have to wait until next meeting to outstand and get the idea .  It is always a clever move to be able to have an image of what is the teaching suppose go and not walk blindly through a learning path . Therefore , Understanding ideas and concepts is much important than learning facts .	SPA
The pesipicuous phrase , `` On the move '' has probably been termed after much thought . Research shows that since the dawn of civilisation , man has been a tourist in a crude sense . This is evident in the study of nomads , shifting agriculture and the like . However , my purpose to highlight this fact is not to discuss history but to merely initiate the debate whether there 'll be fewer cars in the coming twenty years or not . In my opinion , the number of cars produced in the future will be on the rise rather than passing a declination . I would like to support my stand with the following reasons .  The automative industry has witnessed a manifold increase since man has invented the wheel . So , to believe that this rise will ever decline , is highly unlikely and improbable . Firstly , economic reviews show that living conditions will improve in the future which means people have greater leisure time . That goes out to suggest that people will have more time to spend with their families and go out on vacations and using cars people can drive to farther destinations .  Even if the thought is inclinated to the rich , there is another reason to believe why car production will increase . There has always been a focus on science and technology improving the nature of things and cars are not an exception . Infact , lot of investment is going into making solar cars and better fuel efficient cars . Certainly , the expenditure being done on the research is not to never make use of it in the future . This suggests that people want to have more cars in the future .  Lastly , necessity is being combined with luxury in the economic arena as of today . When people have a proportionate rise in income , they use less of public utility services . Taking the middle income group as an example , I would like to illustrate that an increase in income always shifts people 's preferences to personalise commodities . One would definitely want to own something when one has the money to do so and with the economic development throughout the world , people would like to switch to owning their own cars than using the public transport system .  Therefore , I believe that indeed there will be more cars in the years to come .	HIN
I am not agree with this statmen . Sucessful pople can not take risk . They prefear to do what they are doing best . Like who become famust about their area for example starbucks coffe chine . they are very profesional about this and they have to do this job .  first of oll pople have to do what dhey are doing well because they oll rady become profesional about their topics end they can be successfull on their area for sure . For instance a faumest ( medical doctor ) surgen he is doing best on his area but suddanly he deccided to stop doing this job and startted take a risk to do some thing alse . first of ol big wasted knowledge , second he can loss hie fame ,  Secontly when you make your profesion on your area , you have chans to become more profesionel and creatif . If you become mor profesional about your topik no need to take risk . Taking risk may cous lost everythink what you have .  I prefear to do my job or what I am doing best . I am a nurse and I believe I am doing this job wery well . So why I have to take risk and do some think not my profeion . If I stop to do my job I cen forget my knowledge  Every body have to make what they are doing best , then they can be useful for their area and they have cahans to earn but if they take risk there is posability to lost what they have .

I agree with this statement . I think successful people take risk and try new things rather than just doing the same thing . Trying new things make people to realize about their new sides .  When I was in South Korea , I was a successful student . I studied really hard to get good grades in middle school . I was always making A from Korean classes . I loved to study Korean literature and I was successful writing creative stories and poems .  One day , my dad suggested me to study in America . He thought I could experience new culture and learn new language . I was really concerned when I heard about my father 's suggestion . I thought I was only capable to learn Korean . Moving to America seemed really difficult for me . For a long time , I thought about advantages that I can get from America . I had an opportunity to learn a new language and I could experience western culture .  After 3 months , I decided to leave South Korea . I took a risk to go to America and I was ready to challange myself . When I first arrived at Dallas , I was amazed by the size of my high school . There were so many great students and teachers . It was difficult for me to follow the classes but I did n't give up . I always studied after school and I tried to speak with students from different countires . This made me to develop my English skills .  I studied really hard and now I am very satisfied with myself . I am making good grades at school and I made a lot of friends . Also I am learning Spanish in my school . The things that seemed impossible are happening now . The risks and changes developed me as a more skilled and better person . I think I made a good decision . Coming to America gave me opportunities for my future .  I am not going to stop from here . I am planing to learn about journalism and photography . These are the things that I have never studied before . I think taking risks and trying new things made me to develop . I learned a lot from new experiences and I am pleased with it . I will keep learning and I am confident that this will make me as a successful person in future .	KOR
In many situations , as human beings , people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occour once in a while . Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea but , specializing in a perticular area is the step of leaving your name in a history book . The depth of which a perticular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneifitual than having a broad knowledge of every academic subjects . Therefore , i strongly disagree with the statement , since that only guides you more into a --- normal person .  From not only historical evidences but also personal experiences , specialized in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you speical from all the rest , not only so , it is the best way of leading to sucess in future life .  To begin with , a famous biologist english plant scientists has made the most remarkable achievement to the area of biology . But , when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists ? is becuase of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants ; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus , finally he got a Nobel prize for he achieverments . Not only , he will be remembered but his work of investment and achievement to the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of the society .  Further more , a famous French wirter called `` Silva Plyth '' is famous for the poems that she wrote , the sadness and emotions through her poems ; by reading her poems , emotions and a sense of sadness would soon arise . She is not any different from any other poets but , only one aspects which is different would make her so famous , is the fact that her uses of metaphor and the descriptions of surroundings is known to be so percise and carry a sense of shady cloud through reading her work . This , made her work still popular and is now what many modern poets are looking to achieve and trying to copy her style .  Lastly , Not only people that are in the academic area are famous but also , one of the most famous person which most people would know is , `` The Great Michael Jordan '' he is known for his basketball skills . howeevr , many do not know that even though he may seem to be the best basketball player in that time , it was once said by his college professor and his college coach that , `` It seem like basketball and Michael has a strong bond , he seem to only know how to play good basketball '' and sure , the world has prove him right , he had won himself billions and billions of dollors and fame , just simply by doing playing good basketball .  In conclusion , from these examples , we can clearly see that be spcializing in a specic area would not only make one famous but also , it would sure leave ones name in the history book . By this , i strongly disagree with the p	CHI
There are heated disscussion about that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Some people support it , by claim that , young people have more friends than older people do . they are full of energy , and so on . However , some people against this , saying that older people have more children to share happiness and sadness , and also older people have a lot of actities to take part in . As far as I am concerned , both young people and the old people energy life .  As we know , young people in school have a lot of time . they can play with them . talk with them , and study with them . School offers a wonderful stage for young to enjoy their life . In addition , When young people have some problem , a lot of people could give them a hand , such as , their parrents , teachers , partners , bosses , and so on . By their help , the can solved the problems more productive . The young people can sure benefit from that , they also can energy better . Finily , young people have more energy to engoy their life . They can do whatever they want to do , they can experience a lot of new things that older people have never seen . Such as computers vidio games . MSN , ICQ and so on .  On the other hands , older people also enjoy their life . With the developments of science and thenology , the condition of people living enviroment become better and better . The older people can liveing longer and longer than before . The older people become more and more energy and healthier than before . What 's more , the older people can enjor the wonderfull time with their childen , their grandchildren who can bring a lot of interesting and funny things to their parents or grantpatents . Also , the community of people 's living becomeing better and better , older people can take part in lots of activities . Older people can singing with other older people , they can dance , and whatever they want to do .  Sweeping generationlize to this is impossiveble here . I n a world . I think both young and old are enjroy their life better and better .	CHI
One thing history teaches manking is that extremes are never the best solution . They might serve ones purposes for a short term , but on the longer run they usually reveal their shortcomings .  The very same rule can be applied in this case .  At a first glance , the advantages of a specified knowledge seem to be overwhelming . Nearly every modern companie or even scientists in universities serve as good examples . To be successful in your part of busines , you have to know everything about it , and additional knowledge only serves as distraction . Since the times of big breaktrough-inventions are all gone , everybody specializes on a very narrow field . On a small subject , we now have an absolute expert , knowing nearly everything about it . To a certain extend this is absolutely necessary . Who else can deal with nano-composites , for example , exept someone who has studied this subject for many years ? But as soon as an wider overview is needed , this type of scientist very often fails How can he know about new methods in medicine , that might well be adopted within the field of nano composites , if all they ever studied are nano-composites ? It is therefore possible , that lacking interdisciplinary skills often result in disadvantages . Furthermore , a person with a tremendous amount of knowledge on only one field most definitely lacks interest in other things , and therefore misses so many things in life .  The other extreme would be people who know something about everything , but nothing of importance about any specific field . While these scientists might have the interdisciplinary skills , they would certainly lack the knowledge they need to combine anything of real use and importance . There is simply no need for these persons in academia , since a certain understanding of specific problems is always needed .  I therefore strongly support the idea of a combination of these two types . Of course I am aware of the fact , that we can never gain specific knowledge on all academic subjects . This will remain an illusion .  I favor the humanistic approach . Specialize on one or two subjects , but never loose your abilitie to overview a wider field . If you are a mechanical engineer , do n't loose your interest for theatre .	GER
I dont really agree with this statement that `` most advertisements make products much better than they really are '' . Because it aways happens in the other way , that they will not be much better than they really are or they really seem to be . Here comes the difference , they will advertise the product by showing its good qualities and the way it works or so on , but they wil not show its defects , they will not count on those . Perhaps they seem much better when they advertise them and they will convince us to buy it , its after that all happens that we will come to know about the actual performance of it , which is really worse .  But sometimes it happens that the products seem much better than they really are , but note it , sometimes only , it just very rare . I will give you live example which has been experienced by me in the past . Once i bought a video-cd player , convinced by the products advertisement in which it was shown all its good qualities and said its performs better than the remaining ones in the market . So i bought it thinking that it will be a better option to buy the product of that company . But i was completely wrong in my choice , because it was always subjecting to repairs and it was not working properly . I went wrong in selecting , by seeing the advertisement .  Another example is an experience of my friend with a cosmetic product which promises to glow your skin , bought it by seeing the advertisement and thinking it will make her skin glow , instead it left itching of the skin and allergy of skin . So , i strongly stick to my opinion that they are not as much better as they seem to be . I conclude by saying that i disagree with the statement .	TEL
In my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject in study life . This has a lot of benefits than trying to learn a lot of subjects in fact it is impossible to have a deep understanding of various subjects .  First of all you can choose your aim easily and it brings you to reach your destination at the shortest time possible . Also one specific subject would be helpfull in your business career . In the business life , executors look for more specilized individuals . for example it is not enough to graduate from business administration to acquire a good position . one also should have the specific knowledge of Finance or Marketing in order to get good salary . For instance I work in forest industry and I graduated in foretsry so now I know a lot of things about timber , plant , solid wood , and like this .  Secondly , in todays fast grow'ng world if one wants to be employed with a high position in one company and have enough salary to have high standarts of living , he must concantrate on one specific subject and be expert about that position .  Taking into consideration everything one should prefer specializing obout one specific issue and utilize this information to have high career throughout his life . That is why i am choosing .	TUR
I agree to the statement . In my opinion there is famous saying that `` TO GET SUCCESS YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISK '' , i agree to this statement because i feel that success dosent come without taking risk in life . Today is the world of competetion and to compete in this world you have to try new things to get success .  In order to get success , sometimes you try to find out new ways . By going on those ways you think you can achieve success and you often take risk in your life . i feel if people only do those things which they think know how to do well they can get success upto a certain level but can not reach heights of success .  In my opinion every one has its own defination of success and its depends on the person to person till what extent they can take risk in their own life , for some people success means peace of mind or a happy life . But for some success means reaching the heights of the world , to conquer the world so that person tends to take more risk comparision to that that person who is happy in his own world , or to that person has different meaning for success .  For example , if you take the example of CRICKET if a batsmen wants to score quick runs he hast to play slodgy shots in order to take quick runs so he has to take risk . sometimes he get success or sometimes he fails . so its just depend on the person is he ready to take the risk in terms of getting success ? But i dont think you can buy success without taking risk .  Sometimes i feel is `` SUCCESS HAS ITS NEGATIVE SIDE '' . This question always bothers me a lot . Is success dosent come without taking risk ? Till now i am not able to find out the answer till date , may be i have not achieved success yet but the day when i will achieve succes i will come to know	HIN
I agree with the statement , it is a need to take risks in life to be successful , if you stay in your confort zone you will never improve and grow to become a successful person .  We are all born with no knolege , we do n't event know how to walk , that is one of thefirst chalenges we face in life , to lear a new thing . If we were to start life staying safe and not exploring we would not even know how to walk .  Later in life we have to push our selfs to go to school and become part of a class , and keep trying new things like reading writing , improving and getting smarter .  By the time we take that first job we have already done alot of things out of that confort zone , new things , and there is people that in that point of there life are confortable with were they are .  In my oppinion you have to keep going . Trying to inovate , change and grow , learning new skills that can make you successfull in what you really want to do .  Becoming seccessful means something different for every body , to me a successful person is one that knows what is looking to get from life , and is not afraid to try new thing in order to do what make Them happy . I thing everybody shoul take the risk of doing new thing in order to become Succesful and happy people .  The last time a took risks doing something a did not know how to do well was learning to surf . Now is one of the things I like the best in my life and i can not picture my self living in California not doing surf . Taking risk pays off .	SPA
I think i am agree with the following statement . because , i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . In futrue , i think people is not as healthy as now becaus they use cars evryday and everywhere so that they will not use them foot on walk , and in fact , it is bad in ours body , bloods .  people is knowleage and they will know it not far from today	CHI
I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than sticking to what they already know how to do well . there is risk involved in many the things people do . that does n't stop successful people from doing them . an intelligent person takes calculated risks , which would make him/her successful .  imagine how the world would have been if bill gates had n't dropped out of school to pursue his passion . we would n't have had the luxury of using the windows operating system ! he took a risk that could ruin his life but he believed in his dreams .  all the missions to space are risky , there is a huge risk of money and more importantly life . since some brave people have risked their lives for their dreams , ambitions and for mankind to a large extent , we know lots of things about the planets , the satellites and the space . astronauts , inspite of having doubts of their return to earth have travelled into space . if it was n't for their efforts , we would have remained ignorant of the universe and it 's miracles .  business is a field in which a lot of risk is involved . nothing is guaranteed in business . there could be a huge loss incurred from the businesses which are undertaken . but still , risks are taken to achieve greater heights . it 's the same with the stock market . the path to success in business is full of traps and they need to be avoided to reach success . that is what many successful people do .  be it any field , many successful persons have taken calculated risks to reach where they are today . the elegant cricket player kevin pitersen , who is originally from south africa has moved to england to keep his passion alive . the reason for this was stated to be discrimination and politics in sports . had n't kevin pietersen taken the risk of leaving south africa inspite of being warned by the officials that he would n't be eligible to play for his country again , the cricket world would have missed a great sportsman . he was also honored by the british government . he is now addressed as kevin pietersen MBE .  the legendary mountaineer sir edumund hillary along with tenzing norgay climbed the mount everest . the risk involved in it is of the size of a mammoth . they risked their lives to climb the tallest peak in the world with sheer hard work and now they have a place in history . the information gathered by them is a giant leap in geological studies .  these few examples clearly indicate that success comes at a price and risks have to be taken calculatedly .

It is better to specialize in one specific subject . I have a some rasons for my opinion .  First , to specializde in one specific subject is very usefull to get a job . For example , when you want to be a carpenter , if you learn about carpenter specifficaly , you can be a carpenter easier than you learn broad knowledge , because you learn deeply about carpenter , and also corpenter does not need too much broad knowledge .  Second , to have broad knowledg let you take more time to learn than to specialize in one specific subject . So It is very serious problem for people , because thier graduation will be late , and time to get a job become more late .  Third , To specialize in one specific subject save cost to learn . For example , if you have broad knowledge , you have to take much money for many textbooks to lean all of them . In contrast , if you want to specialize in one subject , you can get few textbooks about just the subject . So you do not have to much money to get staff for learning .  In conclusion , it is good to specialize in one specific subject because of getting jobs and saving time and cost . It is vey important reasons .	JPN
I agree with the statement that advertisement make products seem much better . it is because of my thought , survey , poll , and experiments  First , famouse person usally make most advertisements . It appeal to peoples enoughly . most person want to be like actor , singer , and actress . Maybe the product that is advertised by superstar is more attractive to the people .  Scondly , the survey , conducted by cho-sun daily , one of the best paper in Korea , show that three of fourth of overall candidates of survey feel advertised products more quailified . Also the poll , conducted by same company , show that people think that advertised products is more safe .  Thirdly , when I was a high school student , my friend bought a product that is not advertised . It was expensive tape player . It was disorder in next day . My friend want to get gerentee service . He does not get it . So he have to buy again and he buy advertised product , SONY , because of services .  Lastly , When I was young , I had two toys . I do not had discremination between two toys . However , I was perfectly changed in my mind after advertisement of superman , my hero in the past . Although the toy is much cheeper than another , I alway take superman 's toy Because I had proud of myself .  In the conclusion , Given several reasons , I thinks that most advertisement make the products seem much better than they really . It seems that advertisement make us atractive to the product . ..

I agree with this statement . i feel the student understad ideas and concepts then facts . It is clear the student lern more his ideas and concepts rather then the facts in classrooms . Soi agree with this statement . In generally anysubjects are clasified ind two ways either scince or social . Speciaaly in social subject we lern so many things like histry geography economics and civics i tdiffer what we see to what we lern in histry . suppose few contries histry less then the 500 years but those contries are now word bigest lephacanamis and those rool entair world .  In starting of twentiath century ther is no development of electronics scince . now we arre not thinking with of eleconics and computer and power but is it is truth . so many things the ideas and concepts very iportent . like a meterials . their chemical bonding conductvitytypes of meterial these are lern from ideas and concepts only not throuth facts . in meterial we have different types of classification fron thier characteristics  supose now we are disscussed scince class . In this case i would like to discous solour system . insolor system sun is not revolving but we feel sun is moving from east to west in naturally the Earth is moving fron west to east . and i will give another example if we travel any vehicle we feel soroundings are moving we feel we are stationary like that . An other example we feel Earth is like plat it 's not like a sphere shape but actually our Earth is sphere shape not flat shape . But generaaly we feel it is a flat shape ,, if it is plat shape sun rising times and sun set time must be same but it is not true . i feel above threee example we understand ideas and concept s then theit is for then to lern facts .  I give one technical example in this case . in general we are not acept energy transfer in real life but energy transfer one form to an other form of energy . but from facts we are disagree we can produce from heat to cold . in our fact life we feel it 's very diffuclt . but it produced the heat is ( in boiler ) some kinetic energy this kinetic energy converted into electical energy with help of terbine , and finally electrical energy into cold from with help of refregaration process .  So i stangly agree my entair part of discution . `` That is more importent to students to understand ideas and concpts then the it is for them to lern facts '' .	TEL
I partially agree with this statement if we talk about the young people living in the developed countries , say , Taiwan . As I see it , young people in today 's society like technology more than people . Thus they may not pay enough attention to their own communities . But on the other hand , young people nowadays have more opportunities to help other people , because we lead a richer and knowlegeable life than before .  We can say that young people born after 1985 are the generation of information technology . They 've got familiar with usaing computers since they were very little , even at the age of 3 or 4 . Growing up in this kind of background , they seem rather to pay more and more attention to `` machines '' such as person computers MP3 players and game players than to people . In other words , they may spend much more time getting along with these devices of high technology instead of other people , including their communities .  Yet young people , who have grown up in such conditions , have more opportunities to help their communities . Why ? By using their outstanding computer skills , they can help their communities do a variety of things . For example , they can teach elder people how to use computers and surf the Internet . The things like that is very simple for young people yet is quite meaningful for older people who can not use such technology devices . Connecting with the world through computers , and these older people 's life will change a lot . In my neiborhood , there is a young people liking to teach older people in my community . He said , `` by doing so makes his life more meaningful , and he is very happy to use the computer skill to help people . It 's easier for him to do so	CHI
In the today 's professional and academic world it is important to have profound knowlade of a specif subject to be able to deal with the specialized tasks one is confronted with . Insofar students should achieve a profound expertise in a special area . But one should be aware of the following : The question if a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is prior to specialization in one specific subject can misslead the discussion . Actually , specialized knowledge on its one wo n't be enough to deal with the needs employees and researches are faced with in our days . To put it precisely : Your expertise in a specific subject must be accompanied by at least some broad knowledge of related academic subjects and common topics in general .  Today , our society is a very compelx and fast moving entity . That is why it is impossible for a single person to have a useful knowledge in all areas of acedamic research . Therefore it is important to have a specific academic field in which one develops a profound expertise . By doing this one is able to understand the complexity of the subject concerned and follow the inovations in this area . This would n't be possible if one had a broad but purely superficial knowledge of a wide range of subjects . In this case one 's understanding of each single subject would n't be sufficial to solve the tasks and problems which could arise . Furthermore , our society as well as the academic world is moving very fast . It would be impossible to be up to date in a wide range of subjects . But being up to date is a key qualification in our times . In this context it does n't matter if one is talking about technical , economic , social or political issues . All of them are highly complex and are fast changing and therefore specialists are needed in all of them .  But as stated above in the introduction one should not forget the importance of some basic general knowledge . Therefore the best way of planing one 's acade	GER
Recently , there are a lot of cars in the world . In some countries , one people have some cars . Car is very convinient , but there are many problems . I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for 3 reasons .  First , if people who use cars a lot of time will decrease , it will be able to slove the environmental problems in the world easily . Cars use a lot of fuel and cars emit bat gas . It is very serious problem . Bat gas damage to people . If people have a lot of gas of cars , they might be sick . Especially , little children are very weak . If children have a lot of gas on the road , they might be become very bad sick . Today , fuel prices is very expensive and many people worry about money . However , many people use cars a lot of time . People must think about environment . The earth is ours .  Second , if people do n't use cars a lot of time , there will be no area of heavy traffic jams . In the world , there are many city where there occur traffic jams especially developed countries . For example , in Japan , there occur heavy traffic jams every morning in capital of Tokyo . It is very serious problem . Japanese government made a lot of new high way and road , but there did n't decrease a lot of cars . I think that the biggest reason about it is that price of cars have been decreased and many people can buy many cars easily . The best way to decrese a lot of cars I think is that Japanese government tries to make tax of using cars . If Japanese government will do it , cars will decrease .  Third , if many people do n't use cars , there will not be in danger . Driver 's license is able to get easily . Of course , all the people do n't have good skills and sometime , there occur traffic accident . If the test of driver 's license will be difficult , there will be decrease people who can drive , and traffic accidents will be decrease .  In conclusion , if many people do n't drive cars , we can solve many problems , so I hope that many people use train or bus , and there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .	JPN
I agree with the following statement . In my oppinion successful people are successful only because , at one point of their life they were faced with a chalenge and they had to take a risk in order to succeed . People that only stick to what they are good at will only be ` good ' yet they will not succeed if they do not take risks and face new challenges .  Trying new things , ideas , and being able to overcome new challenges is what defines a succesful person in my opinion . For example , if a person is quite gifted at a certain sport and is considered talented , it is still not enough for him to be ` labeld ' as successful . This person will have to test his abilities against other people , try improving these abilities , and risk injury or loss , and improve even more in order to move forward and become successful . If this person did not risk losing to people better than him and overcoming them , he would never know how good he actually is . Another example could be opening a new business . If a businessman does not risk losing some of his money while starting the business , he would not be able to make-up for his loss and gain even more money . Not only is it important for a person to face new chalenges to imporve on himself , but it is also important to proceed forward , and see his level compared to other people or any other competition around him .  Facing new challenges , and taking risks is the only way a person would be able to succeed in life overall . Talent is important yet it 's not the only factor towards success . All the famous athletes , business men , superstars , etc. have faced many challenges and were able to overcome them regardless of how talented they were , and that 's what makes them successful .

I agree the statement . I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . There are a reason to support my answer . Facts are results of ideas and concepts . Good ideal and concept make good facts . However , bad ideas and concepts meke bad facts . So , if students understand ideas and concepts exactly , they can understand why the facts are maked .  In conclusion , I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learnning facts .	JPN
For some reasons we can think that young people enjoy more life than older people do . At first sight we can state this because it is clear that it is easier to be young , in good health with future perspectives than to be old , to suffer and to count the years before dying . Besides , parents often say to chidren that they are lucky . I ca n't deny that be old is not a very funny thing over all for the body , for the health but on the other side it implies that you have lived a lot of various things , you have found your way , you have children and maybe little children . in few words at this age , people have done the more difficult and they can use their time for pleasure , for resting , for what they want .  On the other hand , be young is not such an easy thing and it is often a difficult part of life , over all the teenage period . indeed teenage is the time of self construction , the time to discover love , problems , to take the first decisions . .. And that is not an easy thing because teenagers do n't have a lot of experience yet neither self confidence . In addition , the youth is a tricky period concerning relationships : young people are not nice between each other and a lot of them suffer a lot during this time . Youth and more particularly teenage are transitions and changes times and for that they 're not always cool and easy . You lose some beautiful things like innocence , purity , inconsciense and so on ; you enter in the real world and the deception can be high .  At the contrary , older people have already made their life , they have more experience about life and thanks to that they meet less difficulties to resolve a problem .  All in all , of course i ca n't say that i prefer to be young or old , it is not the question but i think that every age has its advantages and its setbacks . But i do believe that the most difficult is to be young because it implies a lot of problems and questions for whose we are not always ready .	FRE
I think that advertisements are the best ways to sell products . I think the selling and gaining money from a product has a very important and coherant chain . And advertisements pley a very important role in this chain because without an advertisement the product wo n't be known by lots of people , then you will not be able to sell your product to many people because your products is not well known and also because you did n't sell enough to get poeple 's trust so your product is not enough trustfull and because of this you will not gain money . and because you dont have money you will be able to produce your goods . And finally your company will be closed .  If you look to the big companies like Coca-cola , you might understand what I am talking about . Coca-cola today is a huge company and has lots of factories in lots of countries because it did introduced itself to the whole word by advertisements . Eventhough in our country , Turkey , they have a very big advertisements . In every mounth they produce a new `` creative '' advertisements to attract people to buy coca-cola . Because they know that advertisement is a very important and helpful way to introduce new products and also to show and make them remember their old products too . So thats why they put lots of money to advertisements to make people buy their products even though coke is a very unhealthy thing .  For another example fast food advertisements . We all know that fast foods are very unhealty things for us . It has lots of chemical things which are not needed by our body , But when you watch Mc . Donalds tw advertisement and see a billboard advertisement of Burger King , you immediatelly think about eating a hamburger and drinking a coke and eating extremely unhealty French Fries .  So advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Eventhough they are extremly unhealty and and not needed by humans you immediatelly want them . But this making much better seller advertisements are not just foods and drinks , it can be a car adv . or a game console adv . or clothing company adv . or every single think you think of .

I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Because you can make use of ideas and you will remember ideas for a long time .  First of all , when we understand ideas and concepts , we can make use of those in every daily life . For example , when we sometimes learn about Plato , we just have to learn what age he lived or what the title of his books . However , if you understand his philosophy , you have different perspection and old ideas and concepts are related to our present life , so it might your life good .  Second , when we understand ideas and concepts , we will remember easily , For example , please think about chinese characters . We learned it in a elementory school . When we learn how to write , we also learn how come this characters . That is why we can remeber easily when we understand the ideas .  In conlcusion , understanding ideas is more important than learning facts . Understanding ideas and concepts provide us new ideas and make our life good .	JPN
Some people agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . It is because people travel easily if a tour guide takes them . However , I strongly disagree with the idea . I will support my opinion as follows .  First , I am not free to go any place if I travel with others . When I was university student , I visited to the Guam Island with five friends as a graduation memorial travel . After I reached a hotel in Guam Island , I wanted to swim as soon as possible . However , five friends except me did not want to swim and they want to go shopping . I could not reject them . I felt that my wants were limited so much . I was not free .  Second , I can not meet some troubles if others or a tour guide are around me . I believe that some troubles which happens on the travel such as losting a way is interesting thing . Three years ago , I traveled to New York in The United States of America . I wanted to go the Central Par after I arrived there . I tried to go there using a subway . However , I lost my way to there near the times square . Though I could not speak English well , I callenged to ask someone where the Central Park was . A kind man told me the way and I could reach there finaly . I met a trouble and tried to find a solution during my trip . This is my interesting experience . If other people or tour guide were with me , I did not lost the way . And I did not talk to foreigner . For instans , I did not meet the accident .  To sum up , by taking these matters into account , I absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I do not want to travel with other people even they are my friends . If I travel alone , I feel free and go anywhere anytime .	JPN
How do you think Bill Gates made so much money ? One of the answer that can be given is because he did , at a certain moment , something noone did before and because noone did that before it was risky . Is that the key of success in general ? Maybe not but it can certainly explained the success of several business men within an economic context . Taking risks and trying new thing are two factors favoring one 's success in business because of having the advantages of being the first and consequently the best .  Trying new things , first , means that the actor taking the action is the only one in the area . For instance , if I draw a new picture it means that noone did it before me and I am the first to act in this manner . Being the first can give several advantages . If for instance you create a new product that you protect by copyright and that everyone wants to have , you will have a monopole on it that will benefit your company . However , a new idea , product , drawing is not only good and do not always works . That is why successful people are also considered as people taking risks .  Secondly , taking calculating risk in a specialized area make you the only one to benefit of it and w When having an idea , spending lots of energy and money in it will not guarantee its success .

I do agree with the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . It is a known fact that in todays society the word community is not that usual anymore . It shourly does still have a strong meanig in the villages or small towns but if you look at bigger cities you will find most people living along without even knowing their neighbours name .  Especially the young people are not involved in the communities so actually giving time to helping their communities probably does not occure to them at all . One problem is deffinatly that young people already grow into a society that is does not realy care about society any more . So they do not realy have a chance to learn how to be part of a society and that beeing part of a society , in this case a communitie , also involves beeing motivated to give something back to it .  Of course they are supposed to learn it at school but if the parents do not care than the children will keep it the same way . Another problem is that young people often have a lot of other stuff on their minds . Like going to town with friends or to a disco . Working for your communities is not realy considered as `` cool '' and your friends might even start making fun of you if you start giving your free time to help your community .  At last helping your community normaly means working for it as a volunter so you will not gain any money for it . Many young people that want to finance their live or have a bit plus will invest their time doing something they will be paid for .  All these reasons show why young people do not invest enough time into their communities . But it would be so important that they would do so . First of all your community is not just a couple of people living at the same pace on this planet but it can be a wonderfull social network that might help you in hard times . But if you want to be part of it you will have to get to know the people and be part of the team . That is only possible if you show that you are interested in your community and realy try to be part of it . Communities also have a lot of financial problems . So they need volunters working for them so everybody can keep the standard of living people now have . Young peolple tend to believe things would just be given to them without thinking about the work behind it . If the people giving time to their communities become less things will start to disapear . Probably young people than will wonder where the bus went driving kids to school or where the mall comes from where there used to be a park . All these reasons make it so important that young people start to learn how to be an active part of community and why it is so important that they start giving time to helping their communities .

Last week I read an article in our daily newspaper about who enjoys life more , female or male . I considered about these piece of paper a very long time and came to the conclusion that it is more worth to distinguish between young and old people , than between female and male . But neverthelesse I am of mixed opionion concerning this question .  One the one hand , you might get the expression that young people enjoy life more than older ones if you observe from outside . But the onliest reason for that is , that young people live their life more active than older ones . They try new things , have fun whenever there is the chance to have and make their own experiences in order to develope a personality . Students for instance like to go to partys or hang around at the beach playing soccer because they know , that in later professional life they will not have the chance to act like that .  On the other hand older people have gathered a vast amount of experience during their life . Consequently they do no longer feel any pressure to act like younger ones . I believe that they also did have an active , excited life in their youth . But with a certain decrease in age , other things like family , health or financial sercurity become more and more important for them . So in my state of view , they simple have a distict way of enjoying their lifes . They get their satisfaction by going for a healthy walk in the park or having a cup of tea with their husband or wife in the nice restaurant next to the beach . Unfortunatelly these facts are invisble to people you observe from outside , so the wrong impression might come up that older people do not enjoy their life .  All things recommended , I would state that neither the young nor the older people enjoy their life more . Both group has its own way to enjoy their life . The youth often expresses more active while older people are satisfied by a calm and especially healthy life .	GER
Recently , you may realiz the there are more and more advertisements , not just on the TV program , but also in some newpaper and magzines . That make us into a deep thougt of whether the advertisment make products seem better than they really , are . In my opinion , i agree with that statement  To begin with , a products of beed quality cost much on advertisments , Most company spend a lot of money on advertising their products , overcloud the fonction and the use . That is harmful and not resposible to the customers . Actually , many products of good quality do n't afford to the expensive advertisement , so they can not attract many customers .  What 's more , most customer like to find their perference product according to the TV . As you know , most people spend about 1-2 hours before TV . They think the Advertisements is very faithful , especially the advertisement anounce by a famous person . If they like the person , they will trust the fonction of the product . So they waste a lot of money on that . In fact the product is not really what they think of .  Finally , many beatiful words and describe of the products really make it seem to be useful . Many people add some use that is not really existed in the products and also over state the founction of it . Many word soud very reasonable and trustable , it hard for you to analysis the fork and true . So people will easily spend money on pursusing one to have a try . For instant , a medicine can not cure head ache , but the in the advertisement firmly say it can cure you head ache , and make you easy go to sleep .  In a word , most advertisement can make products seem better than they really are , in different way . You must be careful in your like	CHI
This is a very hard discussed question and I believe everybody you ask tells you a different answer about this aspect of the generation gap . But with the tendency that always the other group is accused to be more enjoying as the one you belong to . So everybodies opinion as a young or older person could be affected by such an influence . Thus I am trying not to be affected by such group thinking .  I would say in the overall majority of our society is enjoying their life , although the older people do it more . Surely one could say the young are lazy and the only thing they have in mind is making party . But I think that relates to their younger and more active body and mind . And I am convinced the relatively short time young peolple party can not be compared to the long periods the older people sit around watching tv , play poker , or spend their free time in female chatting clubs . Of course there may be several older people that use their time efficiently by working , keeping the front yard nice or be active in a sports club . There are also people who are ill and can not do what they have in mind . But in summary I want to make a statement about the mean , the normal , older person .  Young peolple are simply doing much more , in both fields enjoing and working , than older ones . I do not know of any of my friends or studymates to think of life as only joy . They are all working hard and learning in schools , universities or learning a handworkers profession to provide the best possible opportunity to get a job and earn money to run a family . Especially in todays time of mass unemployment the younger must perform more not to be one of the workless . That was different in the last decades , when getting work was no problem and there existed shortage in factory workers . Today workers must have a profession and be well preperated for their job .  The older generation is now enjoying their dusk of life in a financially saved situation . When the young people will be the old the situation will certainly have changed to worse .	GER
I agree with the statement that in twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars in use that were today . More and more new cars are getting added to city traffic every day . Improving economic conditions are encouraging people to purchase a car on their own instead of using the public transport system . The city 's infrastructure is not being able to grow proportionately to the traffic resulting increase of jamming of traffic and accidents . A recent health survey has shown that people who get stuck up in traffic jams are more prone towards stress affecting both their pesonal and professional lives . Also , not to forget the pollution of air and sound these vehicles cause everyday .  One more important factor that would discourage the car usage in coming times is the constant rise in fuel charges and lack of availability of immediate and reliable alternatives . The fuel production is not able to catch up with the alarming increase in the fuel consumption .  With the advent of metro rail and other advanced public transprt mechanisms which carry huge of number of people with short span of time to their destination , people would be inclined to use them than risking themselves getting stuck in a bad traffic jam . With aggresive promotion of usage of public transport system by the government , the number of cars could significantly decrease .  Also , with people experimenting with newer ideas of car-pooling where a car is shared by a group of people instead each one of them driving one on their own may significantly see in the reduction of number of vehicles on the road .  Owing to all these factors , people in coming years will be less inclined to use their cars .	TEL
We often hear people saying that young people should enjoy life as long as they still can . Therefore , it is sort of commonly accepted that older people are not enjoying their lives , or at least less than the younger people . We will discuss both sides of this statement , and will express our final point of view as a conclusion .  Young people have less responsibilities than older ones : older people are responsible of younger ones ! As an example , it is rare to see parents buying firecrackers to make a joke to their neighbour whereas it is cliche for youngsters to do so . Young people do n't have to work as to make their family live ; they attend classes and have a lot of activities ; they are young and they enjoy themselves , because they simply have less responsibilities . But this is a youngsters point of view . Do older people really enjoy their life less than younger people ?  Obviously not . For example , having a family and giving birth to an offspring is enjoyable , perhaps the most enjoyable thing in the world ! If older people enjoyed their lives less than younger ones , our world would be a very sad world . .. Thus , some young people do not enjoy there life , and some old people obviously do . The statement ca n't be true because of this simple fact . Honestly , if older people did n't enjoy themselves as much as younger ones , would it be worth to live this ? Obviously if life is not enjoyable , then life loses its primary purpose , and living this life would be purposeless .  I think the statement is a young people point of view , and is not really well thought . At first , we feel it is true , but in fact it is because what we think is enjoyable or not changes when we get older ! Loving to read poetry at the age of 13 is rare , but at the age of 65 it can be fully appreciated and understood , because the person has more experience and can catch the sense of it . I think that how we enjoy ourselves is different , but no one enjoys him or herself more than someone , based on his age . Enjoying life is universal , and has no age . Young people enjoy life as much as older people do , and vice-versa .	FRE
The world we live in had a hard time because of several wars . The victims of the wars are not only this world , but also the old . Old people had to reconstruct their world which had destroyed , whoever did .  Even though there are still several wars , this world relatively got recovered . Old people struggled to get out of the hard time , bringing bacons home for their families , and they kept living for their families . Now they have children who all grown-up , and time to spend for themselves .  People say that the old do n't know how to enjoy their lives ; I do n't think so . They had a hard time , so they know how thankful they are being alive now , and how precious their lives are . They might look like they are still only working , but they know what the life is . They enjoy their lives thinking their lives profoundly .  Young people consider enjoying their to be very important . They go surfing in summer and snowboarding in winter , and they say , `` I 'm enjoying my life . '' Yeh , they enjoy their lives , but they , i think , enjoy lives just for fun . There is no purpose to enjoy their lives . They take it for granted .  Enjoying life need responsibility with purpose . Without it , people underestimate how important their lives are . A young man who always `` enjoy '' his life commits suicide suddenly one day . Even though it might be true that he enjoyed his life , he had no purpose .  Old people have a lot of experiences . They get to have responsibilities on their families , and know how awesome their lives are . Who 's more enjoying life ? I think we have to enjoy with pupose .	KOR
I totally agree upon the statement that most advertisements make products more attractive for the consumer than they actually are . Nowadays it is very difficult to get product that works exactly that way it is promised to .  In a globalised , market orientated world it is difficult for manifacturers , companies or retailers to launch a new product and compete successfully against the other products . Therefore marketers have to think of decent market strategies to get the customers / consumers awareness and interest . To be able to achieve this promotion is needed , including advertisement .  Advertising enables the company to present its product and put an emphasis on its advantages . I certainly have the impression that it is almost presented in a propagandistic way . The most effective channels used for advertising are one the one hand wallpapers in the streets , which make use of visual affects , whereas tv advertisement are even more convincing as they additionally make use of sound effects .  So , if you are the target person and watch the advertising on tv , you go into the shop and buy the product . So the marketer has achieved has partly achieved his aim by then . It is probably not his goal to see you unsatisfied , but most of the time the consumer is . I often think about such a fake when I see advertisement for McDonald . Does the food not look so fresh and tasty ? But what you eventually get looks and taste diffent	GER
the tour guide is very meaningful word for me. becuse i am a student from the institute of tourism . I should say that a tour guide in a group to travel is the best way .  For the starter , the tour guide must be the person who live in the local place that traveling destination . So the tour guide should understand the fellow types of the habits in there . Of course , the beautiful sights and people . For example , my hometown is Sahnghai , there is a deeply history and revolutionary meaning city before the last century . I will take a group of travellers to some significant places , like the `` Chenghuang '' temple , and the `` Wai Tan '' bay and so on . I can provide the varieties of their life , from food to communication .  By the way , I remember a story of my country , a group of traveller from a foreigner country , came the Hunan --- a province of our country . they had stay there for three days , but they have nothing to guide their travel . The heavy rain was caused a flood . After that , they had a sick , they had no medical to care them . Fortunately , a tour guide from the local helped them from danger , because she could commnication with them and found some pills that made from a special plant . So that is why the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide . even it could save the life .  Finally , I will talk a word tour guide in acient China ---- Xu Xiakeng . He ever told some words `` Do n't change your tour propose , but a guide will help. '' the word claims that a tour guide is so much important to a group , because everyone who want to travel have a same dream	CHI
Everybody is confronted with advertisements in his daily life . About 5000 different kinds of advertisements are influencing us day by day . But are the advertisements reflecting the reality , or are they just making the products seembetter than they are ? I think that advert definitly shows the products in a better light , because it does n't mentions the danger of product . Furhtermore , the real price is often not viewed .  Firstly , advertisment should change our consumer habits . Thus , the producted are displayed better than they really are . For instances , Mc Donald 's tries to attract people by showing the consumers photos of their burgers . The burgers in the photo are made of plastic because they look fresher than the real burgers .  What 's more the advertisements do n't show the dangers of these products . Let 's take Mc Donald 's again as an example . It is commonly known that the products of the fast food restaurant lead to overweight . Nevertheless the advertisement do n't mention any of these disadvantages , because Mc Donald 's wants , of course , the people to buy their product . Another example are toys for little children . As they are often produced in China , they contain material of low quality . In some cases , the toys are even toxic for the children .  These are dangers , which are definitely not mentioned in the advertisement , an unacceptable way to distract from dangers in my opinion . Thirdly , the real price is always hided in the advertisement . For instance , the big air lines try to attract people with cheap offers , e.g. one flight form Munich to Berlin for only 30 Euro . In fact , this offers does n't represent the real price , because it does n't contain the additonal fees of airports or the extra costs of the fuel . Actually , the flight costs about 55 , Euro almost the double price of the advertisement .  All in all , advertisements screw up the reality . Mc Donald 's tries to offer its burgers with fotos which do n't view the real burger . Additionally , the hazards of the products are n't mentioned . Hence , Mc Donald 's and Co. distract from the problem of overweight by showing salads which seem to be good for the health . It is a fact that these salads even have more energy than normal burgers . Moreover , toy selling companies want to make their toxic products attractive to the consumer . Finally , false prices annoy the consumer .  As far as I 'm concerned , I think the development of the advert should be stopped . Products should be bought by people because they have a good quality , instead of consumed only because the advert makes it seem much better than they really are .	GER
There are two types of advertisement according to the chronological order . One is post-modern advertisement and the other is modern advertisement . The start of advertisement was with modern advertisement which concentrated on utility of product . Later on , after the cold war period , post-modern advertisement concentrating on the image or impression of advertisement began flourishing and it has been mainstream of advertising technology untill present . Now , here comes the problem . Post-modern advertisement ties mainly with appealing method of impression and to appeal others , it needs such accentuation of positive portions and slipping out negative aspects or to cover the weakness of product competitiveness in utility , they will have to concentrate on overwhelming person with the other good aspects of products such as design . This , can be said that advertisements nowadays make their products seem better .  It might be limited example for my country but as it is fair example , I 'll discuss it . In my country , insurance companies put tremendous assets to visual advertisement . They put some words like `` No additional money to pay for 2 months '' in big letters while they put some negative but crucial informations in letters that ca n't even be seen without glasses . People see the conditions only written in the big letters which seems pretty charming to us , people . However , they realize that they were faked when they actually borrowed loan from that company .  There is other method in making a product seems better than it is . It is not telling about utility or any other practical values but depicting beauty merely . This is especially severe in visual advertisement . Impressing image overwhelms person that the person forget the real use of product is actually limited and sometimes , advertisement uses person 's mind tending to follow celebrities and hire celebrities in making advertisement . Person , just mimic celebrities then .  Surprising psychological method inherents in post-modern advertisements tempting persom to purchase product . By minimizing shortcoming and accentuating merits or by visually overwhelming person without any utilarian usefulness , advertisements shows product better than it is actually and people often dull , get faked by advertisements . Definitely , we 'll have to be aware of this that we do n't get faked . Due to the reasons above , I think that most advertisements make products seems much better than their reality , succesfully .

It is often believed that young people enjoy life more than old people , due to several reasons , which , in my opinion , are related to the availability of time and other physical and mental resources , such as enthusiasm . I believe that this view is , in some way , incomplete , although not entirely wrong .  The incompleteness of the view , is given by the fact that old people are people with experience . This means that they can assess values to certain actions on the basis of their past experience . They know what to do in order to enjoy certain positive feelings , as well as they know what to avoid . This means that people , once they become old , have all the necessary resources in order to exploit their knowledge on themselves , and hence collect the fruits of their lives as young people . In addition , although some people believe that money does not make happiness , old people are more likely to have money to spend for themselves , making them enjoy life in more ways . This would imply that you start to enjoy life only at a certain age .  However , there is the opposite pont of view , which is the one of the statement . Young people , or at least most of them , do not have many things to worry about . It is up to their parents to control and administer the so called ` dirty work` , whilst they are free to grow up . This shows that people , during the early stages of life , have plenty of time to dedicate to themselves , to the discovery of new things . If it is true that old people know what things they like and what they do n't , with the advantage of not having to experiment anymore , it is also true that youngsters have the possibility of going through the process of discovering , which is probably the most interesting and fulfilling of all , as it gives you the opportunity of knowing new things and experiencing new feelings , which were previously unknown . For example , people usually remember their first kiss , rather than their last .  In conclusion , I would say that life can be enjoyed at every stage , when you are young and when you are old , although in different ways . The first period of life should be dedicated to discover what you like and enjoy , whilst the last should be dedicated to the exploitation of such discoveries .	ITA
I clearly disagree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour . I will explain you why around three mains points .  First of all , in my opinion , I trully think that trip preparation is a complete part of the travel experience . If you follow a group led by a tour guide , you will not be able to discover the country or city you will visit in advance . Reading , the Lonely Planet , spending hours on Google watching for some advises on the best places to go is a great time .  Secondly , in a group led by a tour guide , you have to follow . For me , it means that you are not free to do what you want , when you want . The worst thing is that they are telling you when you have free times ! In a trip , I go through a lot of different moods . Sometimes I like moving quickly from one place to an other , but sometimes , and it happens quite often , it is real pleasure to relax , take time , and enjoy the moment . From my point of view it 's essential to follow our rythm .  Last but not least , the departure and return flight are most of the time scheduled in the middle of the night and in unknown airport . We all know that tour guides want to reduce cost and get a better rentability . That is the reason why , they prefer to chose big airplane charter with small seats to put more people in it . In addition they use small airports which are clearly cheaper . The travel becomes painfull , and it affects your trip appreciation .  That is why , I disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . There are many other ways to have a better time in a trip than this one .	FRE
On of the most important in our life is to discover the new thing , I belive taht traying the new thing can help you in thinking and use your mind and that can be the start of creative a new things , when you try new things you can fell excitted not like when you do routine thing , which give you the felling that you are like the machine .  Some time to start doing something without experience of it make you thinking alot before doing it , that is normal way of thinking but as person have mind to think about it you should do the right balance about start new thing or used a usuall method , really it is difficult or lat me say it depend on the situation if i am trying new things that not effect the health , and no dingrous of doing it why not specially if it can help me in discover new thing and use my mind thinking about the best way  One of the most important point is if every one do the some thing that already done in any feild who can we discover new meathod or way in work or life practice so , the successful people is always take the risk which may help in discover or improve thier life .  The life is like school you should learn from it and how you learn . It is by trying by your self and you shuold always keep in mind that there are no limitied of knowledge and the way to learn is doing the mistak , be sure that when you make the mistake or go throw the risk of new trial what ever it is you should learn something even if you did not know it at the same time you may get the benifit later  In conclusion , I belive that traying the new staff could help in making you a creative person , and it can be the best way to learn in your life . Without trying the new thing i think we destry the future and control the knowledge , it will be the major reason for the stopping of our future life .	ARA
Learning about thing differents thing s it 's the basememenmt of our society . Because if every people specialized themselves in one en only one academic subjects in will be difficult for us to discuss together on a general subjects .  In our society ther is continuing changes , we need specialized people who can well understand topics on their favourite academics subjects . Nobody can understand all problems on all subjects and find solutions for those problems , we need experts for that . For examples we are not able to explain how the financial policy of a multinational can effect the company profits . But the people who are able to explain that ; ay be not able to explain how education can reduce violence in poor countries .  These experts are , I think , the ; ore able to teach thier knowledge . It 's important that this knowledge does n't begin a sort of integrism . Even if we are specialized on a subjects it 's important to understand other people point of view . The fact that our society is in a permanent changing put an other problem on the table . What happen to people specilized on a topic became old fashion ? Does this people lost all their skills ? What can they do now ? The key is that people should be able to work , learn and think about other subjects . For examples there is some technology who will become unefficient in the next five years . It 's important for those people who still working on this technology to have the possibility to switch on an over one .  To conclude we can say that it 's important to have some experts on qcqde ; ics su	FRE
I agree with this opinion . Ofcouse there is also chance to enjoy older age however it ups to younger age which people had spended . So I wanna point out three pointsto explain why young people enjoy life more than older people do .  First of all , young people have power to gain what they want or to achieve some kind of goal . In the phisical , they are so young that they can work all of the day without sleeping , sometimes . Besides it , they are not too tired after working . It is one of the important things to achieve the goal . In the mentality , they do n't feel responsibilities for society or family so they can cahllenge something important or need to hard work without thinking deeply . If people become having family or need to care their palents , there is some negative factor to challenge something .  Second , there are opporturnities to make them change or study or grow up . There are chances to take education and study abroad or something . Older people , mostly it 's palents , give younger people to have time to concentrate on themselves , in ohter words , to think about themseoves . It is most important thihg to grow up and have identification on theirselves .  Thirdly , younger people can have time to have comunication with many people who have different backgrounds . Older people mostly have jobs and it is limited to opportunity to comunicate with people in the office and people . On the other hand , younger people have the cahnces to have conversations and have time together with many kind of people . They have time to go all around the world , a  mntality , there is nothing for them to lose . There is only to gain . so	JPN
I agree with the statement but i think it will depend on different reasons . It will be difficult to live without cars , especially here in Italy where most of the trade and travelling is made by cars . I believe that we will all benefit from the lack of cars but we need to get used to other means of transport . First of all , people should start using public transports . In this way , companies will improve their means and they will be ready to sustain the changed habit in twenty years .  Secondly , we should invest more in research and development for alternatives means of transports and to lower the prices of transportations , such as those of airplanes , trains and ferries . Government should also improve infrastructures for there means of transports as often airports , railway stations and harbours are not enough efficient .  As nowadays cars are the biggest source of pollution , it will be positive for the environment and for all of us . Scientists are already working to find alternative sources to make our car running , as in twenty years time , we might run out of petroleum , and this will probably be the main cause for fewer cars . Despite this , we will need to discover alternative sources to make our car running . New cars are already on the market which work with hydrogen , electricity or solar pannels . However , they are just prototypes and we are not sure about their benefits to private transports .  Finally , it will cause less accidents on the roads as most of the deads in the western emisphere are cause by road crashes	ITA
I once traveled to Barcelona , Spain . I took many lectures about Barcelona to learn about Barcelona . However , Guide could still provide lots of information that I never heard of . Threfore , I can say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .  First , tour guides can provide lots of information . When we travel alone or in groups without guides , we have to depend on guide books to gather information of what we are looking at . It gives us limited amout of information . However , guides studied for a long time . For example , to get a tour guide lisence in Japan , tour guide need to major Janapnese culture . So they know many things which we can not learn from books . For example , at the Guell Park constructed by Antoni Gaudi , there is a famous bench which is really comfortable , because the design considered human 's biological structure . Our group thought that this bench shows another genius aspect of Gaudi . However , our guide told us that this bench is not made by Gaudi , but other architect who worked with him . No book included that fact .  Second , guide knows a lot about the region , so we experience special things . Guides know where to have great meals , where to buy the best gifts , and they know about local culture . For instance , my guide suggested one restaurant and we had meal together . My guide told me that if I show chef that I am enjoying the meal by making certain gesture , then they will get appreciated . I did it , and I got extra chicken soup for free .  Tour guides are experts . They can offer information which is not mentioned in books . Since they know a lot about the area , we can experience many things which other tourists can not . The best way to travel is following the lead of wise and smart tour guide .	KOR
In this world full of selfish , helping the others turns to be a way of life for many people , and a great number of them are young .  Despite the generalized idea of the young boy drinking during all the weekend , having as many fun as he can , in my opinion , there are a pretty important number of young people that thinks in the others , in their communities .  Nowadays , it is welll known that , we have a great problem , at least in Spain , with the young people and their motivations in life . But , there are also , a lot of people with strong principles , who enjoy expressing themselves in strikes , forum , etc . There are people who take part of different sort of Non Gubernamental Organitations , for which they spend most of their free time .  Moreover , it is possible to see people cleaning the forests during the weekend , helping in the hospitals , being volunteer in local campaigns for the adaptation and the integration of foreign people .  The Non Gubernamental Organisations have changed the way of working in human rights field , by the introducing of the figure of the volunteer . A volunteer use to be a young person who wants to participate more activetly in the lifes of their neighbours . It is a person who cares about things like , the environment , the climate , the human rights , the animals , the globalisation , summarizing , their communities .  The truth is that many people is concerned about how the things are going , how everything is developing , and among them , the young peolpe . Despite all the wars , and destruction , the world is full of people that truly relief in a better world . I think that we are many reasons to be proud of our young people , because they will be able to go , further than our generation , with all their purposes of a better world .	SPA
Some peopel claim that the number of cars will be down because not only the pollution arised by cars is very serious and but also the various public transportation system is developing . However , I firmly believe that people want still the convenience of the car and eco-friendly cars are developing now .  At first , the amount of the car 's manufature is inceasing continuouly . That is because people would like to have their own car for the convenience of movement . The study by Korean Public Transpormation Instute showed that The main reason that Seoul citizens ' favorate way to go to work was their own cars ' convenience . They can enjoy driving except for the traffic-jam time and do their favorate activities freely , such as llistening the music . Even though the government makes the public transportation better condition , people will not satisfy with their trying .  As far as the environmental issue , it is not a big problem since many contries try to develop the eco-friendly cars . This investment also means that people still admit the cars ' practice and convenience more than other ways to move . Several month ago , in Japan , some researchers inovated the electronic vehicle , which can be used by normal persons . So , in the future more people use will use nature friendly cars .  In these respects , I disagree the statment that the number of cars low	KOR
In twenty years of time the number of cars in use will be in fewer number than there are today . I agree with the statement the author had made . down the lane about 20 years of time the number of cars being used will be decreased considerably vowing to many factors .  A car can effectively work for Maximum of fifteen years , after fifteen years most of the parts in the car would be torn out and the efficiency of car decreases , even if the car is used beyond fifteen years it may release hydrocarbons which may increase the polution . Most importantly our native government is taking to measure to implement the idea of using car for only fifteen years and after fifiten years the car has to sent back to the showroom , or it has to be thoroughly checked to use it , so that the car used will not increase the pollution .  The demand for petroleum products have increased significantly , to run any vehicle we require a petrol . Unfortunately we are running short of petroleum products . Due to scarcity of petrol the number of cars will be reduce as the middle class people may not offerd to pay such huge prices for petrol and maintain a car ,  Now a days the roads which we use are congested because of traffic present . The number of vehicles are increasing daily , adding to the traffic problems . The traffic now a days is such congusted that we can reach our destination more quickly on foot rather tah using car . To have a smooth ride on our car we wish to have a spacious room t drive our car , but unfortunately there is a little chance to expand these roads . So people are finding differnt alternatives for their daily work .  one of the most interesting aspect is problem of obesity in many people . The food habits and nutrients contents in the food had cjhanged a lot and they have no time to do exercise to keep themselves fit and healthy . Cycling provides a good chance of exercise to the body and there is a hope that many people may switch to cycling in nearby futures for a short drive where they used cars before .  I canconclude that the number of cars in the next twenty years will be fewer than cars in use today because of problems mentioned above . The main important problem for the reduction in numberof cars is the availabaility of petroleum products and health problems . Inorder to overcome these problems people may switch to various means of transportation reducing the number of cars used .	TEL
Nowadays the number of cars is increasing day by day . For instance , traffic jams are becoming more and more usual not only in big cities , such as New York or London , but also in small ones , such as Lyon or Bilbao . It is known that the car is the most used way of transport and all of us use it to go every where , although gas price is getting higher and despite the polution that it creates . That 's the reason why I believe that the amount of cars in twenty years wont decrease and , actually , I think it will increase for several reasons .  Firstly , the amount of people who belong to the labor force is increasing and the unemployment , on contrast , is going down . So more people working means an increase of funds in that people and more people who needs to go to work . Maybe not all of them will buy a new car but many of them definately will do it .  Secondly , living standars are becoming higher as time goes by in the developped countries . Then , although some years ago there was just one car for each family , nowadays there are usually two at least . And as living standard are going up the number of cars will go up too , as parents will start buying cars for each of their sons and daughters .  Last but not least , we are living the economic explosion of some developping countries as China , for instance . The economic growth in China is huge , and the increase in car sells is huge too . All the international companies are going to china for both , selling and producing cars , as their past production are not enough to cover the actual demand . Attending to the opinion of the most famous economist , they that this economic period is expected to last many years more . Moreover , this phenomena does not affect only to China but also to the other developping countries as South America and so on .  In conclusion , I sincerously believe that all of these factors to explain clearly that the number of cars is going to increase , and it will be biger in twenty years then .	SPA

Nowadays , there are alot of things the make the young people busy and keep them away from their communities . One of these is the technology facilities like celluar phones , TV , and internet access .  I am not saying that to keep them away but not to spending alot of time with unneccessary things .  To starting to teach the people how to be an effective members in their community they are suposed to recieve lectures or classes that shifting them from personal intraction to community interaction like to be volunteer or participate in the social activities without any refund .  once the nowadays young people get the meaning of the life they will be binifial in their community . nowdays young people some times they have enough opportunity to help their community with good output . But they need help from the community just to guid such people to the safe coast .  Nowadays people are more oriented than the former people because of the technology facilities availability .	ARA
I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . There are two reasons to support my opinion .  The first reason why most advertisements make products seem better is that the most important thing is to sell more products in terms of the producers . In selling products , advertisements are very important because there are many products of the same kind in the world today . In this situation , attractive advertisements are indispensable to compete with products from other companies . Let 's take cell phones for an example . There are many companies producing cell phones all over the world , and each company also provides many different types . Last year , I lost a cell phone and decided to buy a new one . I was a t a loss as to what to buy , and I finally bought one with the most attractable advertisements in a store . After I used it for a while , I easily found that it was difficult for me to use it because of many unnecessary accessory functions . I usually use cell phones only as a mobile telephone , and so I do not need a function of taking a picyure . Therefore , I really found that it is important to discern the advertisements more carefully .  The second reason is that the producers partly believe that the real quality of the products are first known after many people use them . In this regard , producers are eager to sell the products in the first place . They consider the problems of the products after the consumers claim to them . It is not really a good attitude , but this idea is also rampant and is derived from the idea that selling products is the most important thing for producers as I metioned in the first reason . However , society has changed its regard of a recall movement , so this attitude becomes riskier and riskier in the developed countries .  In summary , I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	JPN
I personally think that if someone has a broad knowledge on many subjects , he will be able to find a solution on a larger amount of problems in life/work . If a person has to solve problems on his own and ca n't cooperate with other people , he would certainly be advantaged with this type of knowledge .  On the contrary , if a society is well organized and all the parts that cooperate are well prepared just on a specific subject ( obviously each part has a different subject ) , efficiency can be increased a lot making the society very competitive .  Taking the statement from a more personal point of view makes me think about those people considered as `` genius '' , that improoved a lot in a specific field but consequently had a lack of knowledge in other fields , for example social relationship . This makes them suffer and escape different situations just because they ca n't stand them .  The genius creates something with his ability that will always be remembered and appreciated , but he has to suffer for it . Actually I wish I was a genius on something , but at the same time I like the way I was educated so i find myself in agreement with the statement .	ITA
I think that both understanding ideas and learning facts are equally important for a students , but if I were forced to choose between the options I would say that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning a list of facts .  The comprehension of the idea that gives the meaning to a fact will enable the student to understand all the facts that are based on that same idea . For example : teachers teach the children how to add numbers by explaining them how addition works , not by telling them that 2 + 2 = 4 , that 2 + 3 = 5 and so on . When a child has understood the idea and the concept of addition he 'll be able to make all sorts of addition .  What i really mean to say is that the understanding of a concept will lead you to the full comprehension of several facts of the same kind .  On the other hand i can not avoid to notice that we face a big risk in focusing too much on ideas and concepts : the risk of leaving out the reality . Reality is very important because it 's the point we tend to : all ideas and concepts are studied to give reasons on things we 've seen in our experience , if we do not refer to reality we would be just speaking about nothing , our talking would be only speculation which is not usefull to us .  I would say that we need a balance between the two things , because they are both important to the students : i think that a good method of making them understand a theory or a concept would be giving them examples , because talking about experience is effecive in making them realize what concept we are dealing with .  On the other hand I think that when a teacher talks about a specific fact he should always say what is the idea that stays behind that fact so that he woul obtain two important results : fistly the student would fully understand the fact in its implications , causes , consequences ( for example why a war was declared , what consequences it had . . ) and secondly the students would be able to understand many facts of the same kind because they may recognize the same ideas behind other facts .

There are many advanges in any field of knowledge . They have some connection with each other . If students only learn one specific area that will be misunderstood some parts of academic subjects . In my opinion , I agree with people are better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .  Some academic subjects need students know the others subjects first . Otherwise , they could not totally understnad its meaning or how to figure out the answer . For example , students have to know mathemtic class first and then they can use it on the accounting class . On the other hand , If People have broad knowledge , they can understnad the newspaper what they talk . They also can join any kind of topic to share their opinion . If people only concentre on their area that will be lost many chance to know new friends .  People specialize in one area that 's good for their careers in the future because they can deeply understnad their professionl knowledge . As the matter fact , after graduation , people can gain more specific knowledge when they work . It would be better than learn specific knowlege in school so they do n't need to focus on it . If students learn specific subject in university , they will lost oppontunity to gain more than others areas .	CHI
Nowadys , there is a interesting thing that a lot new products are `` young people '' . It seems like young peopel may enjoy their lives more than the older generation . Every one has his own value about life and different values lead to a compeletely different way of life , so we can not say who enjoys himself better .  Being full of experience , old people have a different thinking about the lives from the young people . some old people who survive from the second world war can understand how important the food or the money is , so in stead of wasting wealth on enjoying lives , they choose to lead a quite simple life . But they never feel their lives are borin .  Second , young people have a strong willing to show their themself to attract a boyfriend or a girlfriend . In order to be popular , young people may like to stay in pubs and bars , they drink , dance and joke with each other . However amost all the older people have already found an acompany , and fashion , cars are less important for them , even they do not want to live as the younger people . If it is not necessary , it does n't make sense to the judgement that young people enjoy life better .  In addtion , age may be very important in some culture . for example , older people can control the younger one in China or Kera . In these country , age can influence many things especially when people is having fun . in these cultures , the society will provide more benefits to the old people . If Chinese people have a lot of food , the old one can obtain more . so it is not ture that young people can ejoy their life better within a less supply .  In concusion , old people are equal with the young people , that is why nobody augre about that at all .	CHI
The following essay describes why I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Advertisments play a tremendous role in our lives . Let me first state my personal feelings about the situation in our society today . I am often irritated and confused when I see all the different advertisements . When I turn on the TV , read the daily newspaper or even when I go outside for a run in the park I am influenced by advertisements . Everywhere in the media and in the public are advertisments and people are oversupplied and do not recognize them anymore . Therefore in order to gain the attention of the consumers the companies have to exaggerate in the advertisements . They praise their products extremely in order to be recognized by the people . The competition is very hard due to the huge variety of products . The increasing significance of communication channels like the internet make the competition even harder because people are now penetrated even more with advertisements and commercials . Only if the advertisement is extraordinary and special people will eventually buy the product . However , in reality the product ist not as good as the advertisment has promised . I have also been dissapointed by a product that I bought for several times . One example is the new iPhone which promises to be much better than it really is . However that is a very subjective impression because other people like the product and are satisfied . As a conclusion one can say that the attitude of a product is a very personal feeling and differs a lot .	GER
It is difficult to say whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject . First I will say that it is important to have a broad knowledge . But then I will show that it is not easy or even possible to do .  Having a broad knowledge is very good . This is why , at school I have learn about a lot of different topics . To know as good about history as about biology or astronomy is fantastic . If I had this broad knowledge I would be able to speak with a biologist or an historian . But it is possible to have a broad knowledge of many academis subjects without being specialized in one particular topic ?  In fact , my knowledge in biology would not be as accurate as this of a biologist . That is to say that , somebody who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , is specialized in nothing . So , in that case it is hard or even imposs to find a job . I think it is important to specialize in one specific subject in order to find a job , or to be able to provide accurate information about a precise topic .  In conclusion , In my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject . But in that case it is important too , not to forget that other subjet exist . So , it is necessary to read books about other topics . For example a biologist must Know about history even if he will never be as good in history as in biology because the may need historical information to explain several phenomenons that he is already studying .

I beleive that young people enjoy life more than older people . First of all , the young have much more free time than the older people . A typical older person would spend their time at work . Most of the time the older people do not enjoy going to work , but have to go anyways to make a living . On the other hand , the youngs do not have work and often enjoy their free time with friends or their interests .  Also , the physical make up of the young and the older people make a difference in the enjoyment of life . Many of the young people enjoy their time playing active sports and/or games . However , the older people can not physically able to enjoy these active sports or games . The human body is constructed to become weaker and feable as they become older at a certain age . For example , there was a young man that loved football and became a star high school football player , but thirty years later , he can not play his favorite sport anymore because of his physical fitness . Even if the old man kept his physical fitness and played football , he would not fully enjoy the sport as much as he did when he was in high school , since he does not have his old friends to play with .  Another reason is that the young people have school which he/she can go to find many friends to enjoy her/his time with . On the other hand , older people have less chance to meet new friends that can give them enjoyment .	JPN
`` Life is just one , and we have to substract from it all as we can '' , I mentioned and used that phrase all my life . Since I was a kid , I understood that I have goals , the ones that made me work and continue through school and college . I experienced a lot of things , which made me the man I am today . I took risks during that time , like moving from my town to get a better education , but at the same time I continue with the same goals and doing what I did best , maths and sciences .  I understand that people do both , they take risks , while they do what they know how to do well . For example , a story about a guy that knows how to sell TV 's to people . After doing that for a long-time period for a `` X '' company , he realized that he could do that kind of job with his own company , and he quit the job . Then he started his own company named with his son 's name . Thats was the huge risk he took but he understood that people like him had choices , and that he will be success because he knows how to do the job .  With that story , an integrationg of risks and experiences can be observed . He do know where he is good at , and he use that to try new things . My experience tell me , that I should integrate both , while they are acceptable . My life is made about experiences , and each day I take risks to keep living .  Overall , I do not agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . People are the owners of your actions , and the success will depend on it . A person can be success by just doing what they know how to do , or by trying new things , which will take them again to the point of doing what they know how to do .  I know that my future is around scieces , but I do know that I have to take risks to achieve my proffesional goal , be a Meteorologist . I have to move from my home-country , knowing that is for my own good . Thats the bigest risk I will experience next year , while at the same time I know how to talk to people , make new friends , and take the best from every opportunities I encounter . Success is around the courner and should experience it with new things or by just doing what they do best .	SPA
I neither disagree or agree the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities for various reasons .  First of all in past times people especially youth has much more spare time compared to present times youth . Morever the obligations of the youth are much more than the former one , as an example in my country due to economical reasons almost 80 percent of collage undergraduates has to have a lte night job to cover up for his or her collage fee and expenses . Therefore it is impossible to make a fair comparison betwwen generations .  Secondly , in my country , Turkey , Although the sharing and helpful community of past turkish culture does not seem to exist as it was 15-20 years ago , there has been an significant increase in both quantity of charity unions and their member numbers with comparison .  Moreover , according to my observations , 3 out of 5 people who joins this kind of organizations are mostly in a age range of 18-30 . they help people with disabilities to adapt the society , arrange a support group for misbehaved children and women , give lectures for poor families children . Today the community services and charity work are done much more organized compared to way back then .  In conclusion , The conditions of today and past generations are very different than each other . Altough it may be seen that youth spend less time for helping their communities stillplays significant role to help it ,	TUR
I believe that a strong conclusion telling that having a broad knowledge of academic subjects are better than specializing in one specific subject would be faulty . There are both advantages and disadvantages of the two .  First , being an expert on a specialized field is unquestionably necessary . The development of science is based on using the knowledge gained by our ancestors . So . in order to make use of previously conducted researches on specific topics and to take them to further points , we need specialists . A man having a broad knowledge in many fields would not work in this kind of a situation .  Second , in our daily life , we can clearly observe the necessity for specialists . For example , think of a situation that you are sick and went to the doctor . The first doctor you went to would probably be a representative of a person that has a broader knowledge on human body . You would expect that doctor to direct you to a specialist for the specific health problem you have . Then you would need a doctor specialized on your problem . This situation also illustrates the necessity for both .  Finally , people that are specialized on a topic may sometimes become blinded by the long times of same kind of work they are dealing with . In such cases , a broader knowledge person could see the big picture and would be more beneficial to solve the problems . To illustrate , industrial engineering , which is my major field , requires seeing the big picture in a company as we try to solve the problems in it . When we deal with the problems stated by a department in the company , we observe that the department does not consider the possible causes of the problem which can actually be caused by any other department . So , this experience of me from summer internship indicates the possible disadvantages of working on the same topic all the time .  In conclusion , we need both specialists and people having broad knowledges since they are both needed for solving the problems of human beings in the real life . So , a clear conclusion that one of the positions is better than the other would be very misleading .	TUR
In one hand , i 'm not agree with this following statement . As we can see , there is more and more people who living on this earth . Progress of medecine , which make us our life being longer , the multiplication of the population let me think that we will be more humans in 2026 than in 2006 . And due to this multiplication , the number of cars sold out each year makes me feel that cars will develop in the same way like the population . Moreover , no governments have for the moment took postion in order to discover a new means of transport . They are elaborating composed fuel ( with ethanol ) or other kinds of fuel , in order to reduce gas emission in the atmosphere but not in the way to reduce numbers of cars .  But on the other hand , many things make me think it to the contrary . Fisrtly , i have talked about progress made by the medecine , in the first section , but it 's also all progresses made in science in general . Something let me think that some utopists had the right key . I 'm attend to wait for a replacement of cars by planes . It 's in my logic . And why do the teletransportation can not be created in the nearest future . Teletransportation can replace cars .  Secondly , i 'm sur that the lack of petroleum which must happen in further years , will be the key of the substitution . Even if we find solutions . .. but today , it is not going in that way . We can also try to limit the numbers of car by instauring mass means of transport , like buses or trains .  Finally , the lack of petroleum is not the only reason of a whispered decline in the numbers of cars . Even if we are still to discover new materials , added to the numbers of cars made by year , we can suggest a lack in metals , plastic , as far as the consumptiom of all habitants of this Earth is so fast .  To me , it is difficult to forecast such a statement , even if i hope there will be less and less cars , and what i hope the most , is that a genius must created the teletransportation , it will be very efficient for all people in all the World . But who knows what our future is made of . ..	FRE
There are many things people should know and learn because the knowledge is getting increse and increse every day , therefore , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because it can help people to improve their social lives , develop their other skills that they have not know yet , and get good jobs .  Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because it can improve people 's social lives . For instance , when one talks to other people who likes sports . Even thouth one do not likes sport , he still can talk about sports topics to other people . Because he knows the knowledge of sports , he can creat good friendship by communiting easily .  Moreover , learning every knowledge might help people to discover their other skill . For example , a doctor always works everyday . One day , she studies dancing , and she feels the dance is her insterest . therefore , she has another skill and interest which has a big difference between being a doctor and a dancer .  Finally , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that it is easy to chang a better job . Because people have a lot of skills and knowledge required by some companies , they probably can be hired by any companies . For example , there are two people interviewing a job . One have wide knowledge , but one has specific knowledge . There are much more changes that the boss will hire the first person .  Conquestly , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make people not only get good social lives and develop their other skills , but also get good jobs .	CHI
Can we say that successful people are the ones willing to try risky possibilities rather than running business as usual ? I would think so . There are , indeed , diffrent ways to `` try new things '' : launching a product that creates a new demand almost from scratch , and adding small changes to the way a business is run as successful people would not necessarily have to make a `` revolution '' and bringing slight changes can sometimes be a challenging risk .  First , let 's consider meaningful changes . When taking a close look at the business world around us , there is no denial that many company leaders have succeeded in creating very profitable products that have sometimes meant the start of a new story for their company . That 's what happenend with Apple when Steve Jobs decided to lauch the iPOD . Instead of merely sticking to the core business of the company , which is selling MAC computers , this leader decided to take the risk and start a totally new product . And , indeed , he succeded , reaching a point at which his product triggered a new way of listening to the music , therefore changing some cultural habbits in the American society , then worldwide and creating a new demand for his specific product .  That has also been the approach of Starbucks , that changed the way people drink their coffee : not any more in a caf , but walking in the street ! There was a huge risk for this success story at the begining , as it involved changing people 's habbits and way of life , but the risk was definitely worth it given the success of the company .  Secondly , we delve into detail in a different approach : the small changes to a business model-but that can mean more , indeed when put into practice . It can also be a significant risk to change slight things in appearance , but a very rewarding one . For example , Dell created a new way to make computers with customarized computers ordered piece by piece by the customers . That was very successful	ARA
I agree with that statement , though i have to admit there are exceptions . Nowadays , it seems to be all about themselves but nothing else for young people .  They do not mind about the ones in need because they are not even aware of such a thing called `` in need '' exists . Their family spoil them to no ends which leds the yoiuth to be unaware of whats going on in their community , let alone the world .  The thing with the young people these days is that they are being brain washed by some industries and they are being victims of these industries . Like the food industry . They created a new form of ideal for women body and nearly all the young girls are concerned about their weight more than anything else , This nonsence is what is taking their mind of other things . Like helping their community !!!  And this generation [ which i am a part of ] is very self centered because what is expected from them is perfection . Which , we all know is impossible to reach . So to reach that impossible goal of themselves , they give their full attention to theirselves .  I know the things i wrote down is a little bit off the topic , but thinking twice , they are somehow related . Youth is striving for an unrealistic goal , making them imperfect by the way of characteristics , just the oppose of what they are striving for . All in all i do agree that my generation is not giving enough time and care to help the others /	TUR
Some people disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . However , I agree with the statement for the following reasons .  First of all , a famous person who advertises products may make us misunderstand the products . For example , I bought a new car three years ago . Because a new car was very high for me , I searched a lot of cars by using internet and talking with salespeople . This searching process continued for about five months . However , the most important factor to buy my car was the T.V. commercial that Ichiro , who was the most famous baseball player in Japan , advertised the car . I loved him very much and if I bought the car , I would feel to be close to him . However , this decision resulted in failure since this car had a lot of problems . If Ichiro had not advertised this car , I would not have bought it . This experience definitely demonstrates that a famous person who advertise products may make us misunderstand the products .  Additionally , advertisements often emphasize on only merits of prodctus . For example , I bought a new computer last year . Because his computer was advertised as the cheapest and latest machine , I decided to buy it very quickly . However , I found that the most of the softwares , such as `` word '' and `` excel '' , were not incorporated in it . Generally speaking , familiar softwares are incorporated in a computer in Japan . However , this advertisement did not express this weak point . If had have all of the information about the computer , I would not have bought it . This example clearly explains that advertisements often emphasize on only good points of products .  In conclusion , I definitely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	JPN
I ca n't agree with this opinion . Thinking of my business experience , I feel we can lead the ideas or concepts from to learn the facts or the experiences . So , to learn a lot of facts or experience on past is important .  As first example , my company provides the seminar about the businnes process periodedly . This seminar is introducing the methods and the process about the business that is relational with our industory . In this seminar , we use the presentation documents . The concepts are written in this documents . After the seminar , we collect the questionare from the participants . They often say that `` Please introduce the example or the facts using the business methods more '' .  Second , when we do the project , we explain the process to our team member . They ca n't understand how to do with only explanation of the concepts . If we explain with to use exaple , they understand they should do sooner .  For doing ourselves , we need to know many example or facts .	JPN
I do agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  successful people usually come from many failures and risks and after overcoming all this situations they gain success . So those people have a clear idea about how to tackle or overcome with risks and problems . The man or woman who is usually successful prefer gaining more success from more new things or the things which he or she is unfamiliar with .  And in order to try new things they never hesitate , whereas , the man who is usually under a nonsuccess stage fear to try for new things . There are many examples which support the answer . For instance , in the consturction field people usually succeeded in the field of consturcting huge buildings , dams , towers and flyovers which is usually a risky factor at those days . because they have succeeded in there field they are trying for more new things like going for more huge or enormous works which is also a bit kind of risky . Because the consturction field people know a lot about there works and failure which they will meet in achieving things they try to solve them in more logical manner or say in an planned order .  Not only in consturction field , we can go for other fields like the most happening scientists field where they try only for new things rather than going for the know ones . Scientists always think of inventing about new things . If they would have taught that they cant take risk in inventing anything which we had now then we couldnt get many luxories and also disease preventing medicines for many hazardous diseases which is usually harmful to humans .  When we go for new things then only we get new things in our day to day life which are becoming part of our daily life now-a-days and also daily routines . Hence in this fast moving world , successful people should try for new things and should take the risks to become more success , rather than sticking of only doing what they already know how to do well .

I think it is an interesting statement and in the following sentences you will read my opinion about this .  My private opinion is that it would be a great issue for the plants and humans healthy when less cars pollute the enviroment with gases and noise . Also it is nessecary to built roads through woods and fields whrere many wild creatures live and so their homeplaces were destroied .  People can also go by train , bus and bycicles or by feet or drive together with other people in one car , instead of driving alone .  I think changes in getting oil will force this behaviour . Oil recources are decreasing remarkable in the next twenty years and the price fot oil will increase strictly . So many car owners wont afford the higher money for gas , because their income will stay the same .  For the car industries and the jobs which are connected to it its a dramatic thing , because many people will loose their working places .  When I think about all this it would be the best to make now plans what we should do with the problem . First we could built new possibilities in transporting people and find new ways in exploring other recources we have on earth , instead of oil .  Maybe it could be a possibility in twenty years for us to drive cars with energy from water or sunlight . The cars could have solar sstems on the roof . So the air would nont be polluted bz this way .  This would be a great	GER
Nowadays , the majority of old people is frustated and isolated from society . Old people have no life quality and numerous of people are saying thate old people are only waiting for the death . The contrary shows young people who have a variety of possibilities how to create their lifes and waht to do in their leisure time . This implication suggests that young people have a better life quality than older people . To proof this statement and conclude an opinion , existent facts have to be taken into consideration and evaluated .  Many experts say that old people are not interested in taking part of the society with a specific age . Furthermore they enjoy living isolated and don ^ t want to be members of big communities , they prefer their privacy . However more and more possibilities for old people to create their life time are integrated in society . In addition , numerous old people with the age of over 60 are still sporty and modern and not like many years ago , isolated and frustrated . The interest of old people and their activity in several communities underlines the fact , that there is interest but old people have to be supported and motivated to join different clubs or activities .  Secondly , some people are convinved that mostly all old people are ill and have problems with habits they used to do when they were young . They believe that older persons live with pain and are unable to create theit life without help . To a certain extend , there is some truth in it , but because of the constantanously innovation and the developement of researches concerning cancer and other illnesses old people had to deal with many years ago , specialists found many ways how to enhance the life quality of old people , which can be seen as a reason for the increased living expectations of humans .  To sum up , numerous of ways are created how to make life more enjoyable for old people and the positive reaction of old people to different communities and sporty activities , show that tey are enjoying theit lifes , although they are not able to do what ever thy want . It can not be said that young people enyoy their lifes more because it is always depending to your thinking .	GER
I agree that most Advertisements makes products much better than they really are as i buy only the products that are seen ads in tv .  when the product is new to markets they have to Advertise it . If the product is launches without the ads now one knows what is it and they donot buy either . Advertisements are given for products and relase into the market atleast people recognises it . It may buy some people and if it is good they will use regularly .  All the popular brands in the world are investing the one quarter of their money in the adds . This shows how much important for a product the to be launch . Advertisements are not the new idea it has has been practise since the ancient times . In ancient times the ads are in the form of curved in the stone .  To know wheather the product is good one are not only can say after using it only . Eventhough lot of campain done for the products if it is not so worthy the results will be no one afford to buy it . product itself has stuff otherwise no ads can do it promote its sale . For example my father has buyed Daewoo motors matiz car by seeing the ads later it has lot faults then my father told his colleagues that donot buy that one . The feedback fot that company is not good . one buys it as aresult it got flopped in India .  Nowadays the Advertisements is one of the good markests in the world . All the products hire the celebrities to be their brand . Kids influence for it , if thier favourate star ads for it they will want to buy it . Every field require ads to promote its product for example movies star campains before the prrmer to promote their movies , similarly the models are launches to popular brands of car , inauragation of malls ets . These create the hype of their product even such that some of them talk about their product . Thus it shows that their product reach the people .  Wheather the product is good one are not only can say after using it on . lAll the above reasons shows that one can buy only when they know about the product this can be done by Advertisements .	TEL
I definitly agree with the idea that it is more important to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts for students . There are 3 reasons as follows to support my idea .  For most of human beings , the ability to learn facts is much stronger than that of understanding ideas and cencepts . Facts equals specifiction and concept stands for abstruction . For an example , we may distinguish a hign value picture from a low value mainly by the whether it look like the real stuff or not . On the contrary , experts define the value of the painting by their colors or some painting skills . We may not understanding the essential thiings in Van Gogh 's painting beacase we even not kown what he drawed on the paper .  For another thing , it is easier for students learn things from teacher than learn by oneself . That is the reason that teacher can make some specific examples and facts to descibe the new concept which made students make sense easily .  When it comes to learn facts , we can not take into account the part-time job . Why there are so many students like to take it when they are in school ? Because it proive some interpersonal abilities with them which are not learned from book or classes . Additionally , they learn things with the joy of earning money .  In spite of this , understanding ideas and cencepts are basic for students . Such us some acdemic subjects math , caculation , science , historyand social science , they are essential for students to learn something new . Suppose a man can not read or writing or simple caculating abiliy he will learn nothing even he know quite a few of facts .  At last , in my opinion , i thing understanding ideas and conceprs are as important as learning fact . We may build up tow sides abilitly at the same time .	CHI
In our society students were confronted with new knowledge in school , but the question of whether or not it is more important for them to unterstand ideas and cencepts instead of learning the facts it is another matter .  From my point of view it is very difficult to take side over the other in these argumentation because it seems to me that there are both advantages and also disadvantages .  In the following passage I will make my point of view clear .  On the on hand , I think that it is in same subjects important to unterstand the idea and the concepts . In this context I can mention my own experience in my school time . I realized and unterstood Mathe just because I really learnt the different ways which I could choose to come to a solution . It was sometimes definitely hard to unterstand . However , it leads to a deeper unterstanding in this area . Another argument I can mention in this context is the history class i attended . History contributes so many facts of the past which are not essential to become an educated student .  While there are positiv aspects for becoming aware of a good unterstanding of ideas , I feel that it is in some subjects not necessary to unterstand the whole background of the subject . Sport for instance is a very theoretic lesson and the history is not important .  Consequently , my argumentation makes clear that it depends on the topic if a teacher really should confront their students with all the information which are available or if he better focus just on the important and significant ones .

Some people say that nowdays young people do not have enaugh time to help their communities , that because of the rithm of our lifes we , I am 19 years old , do not have time to help poor people , to talk or to be with old people who feel alone , to make thing to help to reach the peace in some countryes or even in some families . ..  It is true that our lives have a very high rithm and that we do not have a lot of time to help our communities , but that does not mean that we do not want to do it . Some yeras ago young people did not do lot of thngs for their communities , but the implication of the new generations in the projects of help has increased a lot during the last years .  We can see that there are more NPO 's , no profit organizations , and whose members or the people that calaborate with them do it totally free , with no maney retribution . The objectives that these NPO 's try to reach are really different . There are those who help poor people that do not have nothing to eat or those who help dependient drug people . There are also some corporations that help to preserve the environement , like Greenpeace , and those who help in general kids , like UNICEF . Others try to help woman and others try to figth against the illegal prostitution .  There are lot of organizations that try to help our communitie and that are gowing in the number of activists To sum up , I will like to say that more an more young people are helping other people , even if we do not have all the time we would like to have to do this activitie . But young people are trying to find free time and spend it helping others , what make us more humans .	SPA
I agree that successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . I have three reasons to support my answer .  Firstly , taking risks is a way of finding new chances . I think the bigger the risk is the bigger the chance you have . And to make that chance your own you willneed hard work and that will make you a strong person .  Secondly , taking a risk and tring new things can give you new perspective and can make you have a bigger knowlege that can help you to become more successful . For example for me to start cheerleading in my highschool was a big risk for me . Becase I used to be very shy person and did not like to do things in front of every one else , But for me to start cheer gave me the courge to let myself out in front of the croud . The practice are very hard and that made me a stronger person then I was before .  Thirdly , tring new things gives us an oprotunity to meet different people and know there thoughts . and give us new prospective .  These are the reason I agree with this statement .	JPN
It is undoubtedly true that in twenty years the number of circulating cars will be strongly reduced . Although many people may believe that this statement is simply ludicrous , It is possible to provide some good reasons to support it . Two main aspects of this explanation are the consequences of the environmental problems caused by cars and the problems caused by the constantly rising oil price .  As everybody knows , cars produce toxic smoke that pollutes the air in big cities . For this reason many governments and city administrations are restricting the number of cars that are allowed to circulate in city centres . In the long term this will led to a change in citizen 's preferencies , i.e. they will prefer using public transportation to using their cars because it will become simply too difficult to drive a car in a big city . To support this opinion I could quote a research study on this topic carried out at my university that shows that people are becoming more and more unwilling to drive their cars in big cities .  Another point that could be made is that having a car is becoming more and more expensive . The first reason for this phenomenon is that oil prices has become very prone to rise consistently at any threatened decrease in production . Grassroots people have already many economical problems and this one will become too awkward for them . Another thing that influence the cost of having a car is the fact that governments are discouraging cars buying by imposing taxes on some ecologically dangerous cars . For example the Italian government is willing to pass a law that imposes a tax on big cars .  These two reasons given , itis not difficult to understand why I think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than	ITA
In my opinion , young and older people enjoy life equally but in different ways . Being young or older have advantages but also disadvantages .  First of all , when you are young , you do not have the same pleasures as you are old . On one hand , when you are young , you enjoy your life at the current moment . Indeed , during your studies , you prefer to go out with friends , to do sport , to discover new things by travelling . .. However , on the other hand , when you are older you enjoy different things of the life . Indeed , you want to get married , to have children , to buy a nice house , to go on hollidays with all your family , to succeed at work . ..  Secondly , responsabilities of a student are totally different comparing to an older person . Indeed , as a student , you do not have many reponsabilities because most of cases , you do not have a child to take care of and you depend a little bit of your parents who help you financially . The main responsability of a student is to have good marks and to succeed in his studies . When you are older , you have much more responsabilities . If you have a family you have to take care of by working , buying food , paying bills . .. Having responsabilities as an adult enable them maybe to enjoy less life . However , having reponsabilities can be a good thing for some adults because thus they think they are usefull .  Finally , young people can enjoy less life than older people do because they generally have less money . If you are a student , it is more difficult for you to go on hollidays or to go regularly to the cinema . In most of cases , students have to work and go to the university at the same time in order to pay their distractions and their university . Contrary , older people does not have to work and study at the same time and generally they have a better salary .  To conclude , when you are a student or when you are an adult , you enjoy life differently because their situation of the life is different	FRE
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for many reasons . First , trying new things gives you an opportunity to learn more , for example , learning to drive can make you focus more and see more . In addition , you can be more experianced when you take the risk and try new things , the more you try the more feeling that you get that you have no limitations in what you can do , the more experinced you get . Lets take the CEO 's of the big companies for example , if they did not try new thing and if they did not take risks , they definatlly would not be where they are now . Third , trying new things and taking risks makes you more ready to solve problems .  On the other hand , not having the guts to try new thing and take risks could concequence in beeing in the same position for a long time if not for ever , . Yuo will do your thing right , but you will do it for ever . In conclusion , dont limit your self , dont underestemait your self , go out there and try new things and take the risk .	ARA
I disagree wtih that to understand idea and concepts is important for students . There are two reasons ; step of study and correct idea .  The first reason is that it is neccessay to learn basic knowlege for understanding ideas and concept . If students are lack of basic knowlege , they can not understand all of it . For example , students in Japanese university primaly learn basic fact . Then , they begin to study application one . It is derived the evidence during long educational history in Japan . So , it is important step of study for students .  The second reason is that learning facts is essential for correct idea . It is doubt that students truely understand ideas and concept unless learning fact . For instance , nutritional study , students do not know nutrients , they can not understand metabolism of their body , and can not find new idea and passway of body system .  For these reasons , I disagree with that to understand idea and concepts is more important for students than to learn facts .	JPN
Unfortunately I have to agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not invest enough time to help their communities . In my opinion a possible reason for this development might be the lack of a strong incentive for the young people to spend their precious free time on helping the community instead of maybe hanging out with their friends , playing video games etc . As especially cities grow to become more and more anonymous , young people do not see the reward of their work in the community as they would in a smaller one where everyone knows each other and the youth would get more appreciation for their voluntary work . This is , of course , a misconception , because volunteering for a good cause is appreciated in both environments , it just may be not as obviously to the young people . So the question is : What do the youth do with the time that they once spend on helping their communities ?  They spend it on activities that they simply find more pleasurable . In fact , this is a trend that we can detect in all layers of society and in all ages , we do not need to search for this phenomenon among young people only . Of course , it is more fun going to the cinema than helping elderly members of the community . So what we need is incentives . We could get incentives from the parents , helping their kids realize at a young age that it is important to take responsibility and help out in the community at least every once in a while , depending on the child . Small activities done for the community may be more important and more valued than one might think and every kind of work is strongly welcomed and appreciated .  The community itself must have a strong core in order to create networks and to attract the young people through for example specific institutions and activities only for the young . I say this , because I believe that only if the zoung people can identify themselves with their community , at least to a certain extent , will they be willing to become an active member and help by investing a bit of the work as well .

I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Due to advancements in technological and financial markets , access to money is easy . Because of the excess liquidity in the current economies around the world many companies are expanding their businesses . There are a number of companies that are producing same kind of products . They themselves know that it is extremely difficult to produce something different every now and then . But they all have realised one way of selling same products in different packaging to customers .  Advertisements !! Now technically they know that they ca n't differentiate their own product from other products available in the market . Let 's take an example of a car advertisement . It 's an entry level car Hyundai Santro . They have Mr. Shahrukh Khan ( Popular Filmstar ) as their brand ambassador for India . In their advertisement it 's shown that Mr. Shahrukh goes for a long drive with his girlfriend ( who is again a big filmstar ) . Now everyone in the world knows that Mr. Shahrukh sends a BMW to pick up his kids from school and drove santro in the advertisement for first and the last time in his life . But people are fascinated by this and buy cars just believing that if he uses it it has to be a good car . Having one myself , i know it is a good car but not because of the advertisement . They show that if you use this car then you may get good looking girl freinds but actually it has nothing to do with the car .  I think it is appropriate to discuss example of an advertisement of Bournvita . It is a drink for growing children . They claim in advertisements that if children drink this they will grow faster and healthier . Now if that was the case then producer should be the richest person on planet earth . I agree with their claims regarding content of the drink mix , Calorie content and presence of proteins etc but I ca n't believe this increase in height part .  Let 's take another example for a telecom service provider . In it 's advertisement they claim that they provide hassle free and customer oriented service in their outlets . I fell into the trap and took the connection . For the first time when I went to the outlet for a complaint I was left there to wait for half an hour . Eventually after having a verbal argument I took a pledge not to believe advertisements .  I belive that to survive in this cut throat world companies will always invent ways to sell their products . Advertisements is one of them . Whatever you see on TV , you should not believe it as nothing in this world is as simple as it appears .	HIN
Young people are an intergral part of the communities/societies in which they live . They develop their skills and gain education from their people - their families , teachers , friends and other people in their society . I being a youngster myself believe that I have acquired the values and principles of my life from my community . We younger generations owe our life to our elders , so we can not neglect them . We have learnt to respect our elders and people in our society . Therefore I would not like to agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to their communities .  Young people attend colleges studying different disciplines - science , commerce , humanities etc . But they participate in a lot of other activities outside their curricula . There are numerous clubs and organizations formed by youngsters that invlove themselves various kinds of community activities like protecting the environment by spreading awareness among the people , fighting for social evils like corruption etc . In my university itself there are several student societies like these . For example , the Nature club , whose members spend their time to make people conscious about issues like noise pollution , harms of plastic etc . They express themselves by various means like banners , conducting quizzes and so on . Similarly there is another club which raises its voice against many social problems prevalent in my country , for example dowry , female foeticide etc . I myself is a member of this organization and we organize various activites like trips to local neighborhoods , staging street plays to spread our message .  Another aspect that shows the commitment of young people to their communities is their increasing interest in political issues . In my country , right from the college students compete for different positions in the university politics and they have an important role in bringing important national issues to discussion forums where students can discuss about possible solutions to them .  Young people also contibute towards economic and technological development of their communities by implementing new ideas . For example , they can use their education to help create new types of jobs by being entrepreneurs . In this context I wouls like to add that many alumni of my college who have now gained imp postions in society contribute by giving donations to various social organizations .  I do agree that there are some youngsters who forget their people in order to earn money , who leave their countries for better life , but a large majority of them including me are determined to serve their communities from where we started our lives .

Succes  I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . I agree with this statement because if a person do only what they know how to do the best , they are not chalenging them selves and become just like others , who dose not try their best , around you . To challenge and to explore and taking risks will lead to a success .  To me the meaning of success is to do more then you can do . To do more then what you are , you need to try new things or even new ways of trying and take risk doing it . Eventualy your efort will pay you back in many areas . The success could be diffrent then how rich you are . The money dose not define success .  I belive that the success is not just about making money but how to be diffrent from other people like how much you know and have exprinced . You may not be successful even after you try new things and taken risks . But the exprience you have and more knowlege you have then others makes you successful .  The Success is in you . How much you have improved from befor show how much successful you are . When you succed on some thing that you thought it was hard but you tryed and take risk of failing . That makes you successful and better then other not becuse you more money and power then others . Every body have diffrent situation and diffrent level of success . And if you succed in you the power and money will follow .  Thouse poeple who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well will succed no matter how much they have improved or how much richer you are . You are a still better then you used to be and did not stay in your confort zone . That is why I strongly agree with this statement .	KOR
I think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts to help them to learn facts . Without the understanding of the concepts and ideas required , it will be difficult to catch the core of the passage or the thorey . Of course , the fact will be useless when the main idea is not transported to the students . All of us have heard about the `` funny stories '' . These informations we heard from other people are meaningless in most of moments , but why we will lough to tears and catch the meaning of the words instead of just understanding the fact which means nothing to you ? This is because the fact is like the lower-divison course which just lean the listener or the student to understand the surface of the words , yet more important information the `` funny story '' would like to send to the listener is the idea and concept , that is upper-division course , including under the surface of the story . I believe this is the key and most of us should be concerning about .  While the facts sometimes really improve our cupboard of the knowledge of the news we are not familiar with . But the fact is thst its useness is such a little part of the mean benefit we transport the information . We should deduce sometime , to croop the inside idea and concept to learn the fact much more clearly . Without the understanding the core of the delivered information we even will mis-understand the meaning of the fact and never will get rid of the darkness of the mis-understanding .  Bewildering amounts of students just read about the Time News to catch up the world and the campers . They hardly have the enthusiasm to dig a pool to summerise the mean idea of the situation they are facing . It is indeed the polution of the information surrounding them . As the result of this , with the incompllicated understanding , they make comments to others , and they always indulge in this mistakes . This is just like a `` hoax '' or deception . They think they will never plead ignorence to anything without knowing that they are making the countless mistakes . And these mistakes will overtake and ruin them some day . Only because these students could not see what is behind the fact , ideas and concepts .	CHI
Although some may believe young people nowadays give plenty of time helping out their communities , I believe they do not . There are two main reasons : their attitude and lack of time .  First of all , young people nowadays do not have the attitude or motivation to help out their community as they believe it has no benefit on them . These young people believe they do not need to help out their community as they believe other people will do it instead of them or its simply a waste of time . I believe they do not understand the moral of helping the community in need . Furthermore , young people nowadays are a lot lazier than they used to be and so they lack the motive as they consider helping the community will be '' work '' , and as we all know , young people tend to dislike work as it is not enjoyable . This motive is probably influenced from school work which is more of a requirement rather than a choice .  Secondly , the fact the world is becoming more competitive and also a lot more interesting , youngsters are becoming more involved in other activities and their studies rather than contributing towards their communities . These young people may have objectives such as going to the best universities or simply enjoying life by relaxing , and in my personal experience , I have never come across a young individual who actually wants to give their time to help their communities . As a result , as young people prefer to spend their time in a different way , there are very little that feels they should help out their communities .  In conclusion , as young people are not tempted to help the community as it is not enjoyable and the fact they have better , perhaps more important things that must be done , young people nowadays do not give enough time nor effort to helping their communities .

The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be splitted into two parts . One the one hand are people , which try new things and take risks to fullfil their target . On the other hand are people , which do what they already know to do well .  Such two different types how to handle with risk will reach the final success . People have different kinds of meanings about their own apility of risk . If I think about such difference , I will talk about two friends of mine . The one boy is about 35 years old . He reached one of the best school examination with a grade of 1.2 during his school periode . He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studing time of 4 years with a very good grade . His first contact with the economic or in gereral with business had taken place for him with 26 years in a big company as an assistante for law specific questions for consoulting contracts . He was very resistent against risk , maybe because of his first contact with the business world . He had been in such office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experiences , but also without trying any higher risk , than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time .  My second example is a boy , who is 28 years old . He finished school with a grad around 2.5 , which hab been the middlefield in his final examination year . He started an own business idea after his examination . His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and middle sized companies . In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consoulting work of his company . He had have a lot of fixed costumers , which needed his help regularly . During such periode he had have the idea to export the concept to other countries , which he started in 1999 with Austria .  Banks helped him to fullfil such target by offering a lot of money . After two years he had have 4 office outside Germany and a sum of 4.500.000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank .  The concept failed by the crash of the new market and he lost all the life standart almost in 2 month and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time .  As a conclusion of my two examples , the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education , meaning the final examination grade , and the university status .  Moreover people with a ability to try risks , will have a faster success and will be stay there , if they control themselves regularly . The risk of falling down , because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparision to the risk resident people .  However , every human beeing have to know for themselves which goals and objectives he or she wants to reach and how fast to get there . In adition such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success .	GER
I agree this statemen . Successful people try new things because they want to get new degree . There are several reason for this .  All people who have alot of achievement do n't satisfied to try new thing . As their ambitious force them a new achievement , they want to learn new things even if it is risky . They consider taking a risk about one different thing they did n't know before about it because this kind of people do n't like monotone life . In my opinion , this kife is better than the other . Trying to new thing adds to our lifes numerous new concepts . For example , I like playing soccer . When I was in my country , I played soccer every weekend . After for a while , I bored to play soccer . I want to change someting in my life style . Before I came US , I did n't know about American football . Now I am learning about it . I also like it , I learn several new rule about sport , so it encourage me to play it . The other example about risky . I had took phd education for two year in my country . I want to change my education place even if it has many riskies . These are spending alot of money , passing the toefl exam , and complete a new phd education in US . They did't know how much money I spend before . I also did't know Whether or not I will pass the toelf an complete a new education . I take i  People who are successful develope theirselves by trying new thing . They create new methods to do something , so they help them to try new thing . Now , we assume that a student who prepare for toefl . He developes new studying methods , so he finds better solution for studying . Then , he can use the methods for the other exams such as gre .  Every person who have alot of successes try to new thing because of yheir life style . They do n't like doing someting they already know . Their has a kind of sense , so it pushes them to learn new things .	TUR
It is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts which were once stated by the people itself . Facts are nothing but inferences drawn after experiencing and researching on those issues by the people who were once students . Once the concepts and ideas based on a particular issue are known by the student than the facts can obviously be drawn in the end .  It is a fact that SUN only rises in the east and sets in the west . This fact if was just agreed by the people blindly than the world today would have been different . It is also a fact that an apple when thrown upwards always falls down . If this fact was also accepted blindly than Isaac Newton would have not known to the world .  There are enough facts that has been known by the present world . To draw more facts the student first needs to study a particular topic , do research in that area and understand the basic ideas and concepts behind that area . It is only than that new facts could be stated .  Facts are just a single line statements that can be learned by anyone . In order to reach a postion it is for a student to learn the concepts .	TEL
An increasing number of students realize that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts , Unfortunately , there is a growing opposition among the other students , who maintain that learn facts is the most factor in their studies . However , in the final analysis , I conclude that the former one does make sense . In the following discussion , I would like to present some point to support my statement .  In the first place , the key point for my view is that understand ideas and concepts , undoubtly , which allow the students to cultivate their ability of self-study is play the most role in their studies . Actually , the final aim of the students study in the university is to promote their sense of think independence . For exam , in their beginning studies , they need a teacher to guide them . But in their future studies , they must deal with the problems by themselves . Of course , they need to practice their capability to solve the problem when they understand ideas and concepts in class .  In addition , the students can understand ideas and concept by themselves to check out what they have learnd in the class . It is benefit for them to build up their self-confidencial .  Furthermore , It is the best way to supervise the students . If they ca n't understand and concepts , they would failed the exam at last .  Given the reasons above , which sometimes intertwine to form a organic whole and thus become more persuasive , and we can arrived at the conclusion that inspire the students to master the ability of understand ideas and concepts in the class must be undertaken by the teachers . Only by this way can we implement the qutity-education ; only by this way can we enhance the self-confidence of the students and only by this way can we supervise students ' study in an efficient way .

Probably in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are now . Today in particulary in Italy there are a very big problem about traffic , smog , parking , because the mostly of the people has a car . In fact in a normal family there is minimum one car for each , while in a rich family you can find also more cars than the persons , who stay in the family .  In nowdays you can have and drive a car when you are fortheen , the youth don-t drive any more motorcicle , a little special car . For these reasons in many cities you could-t drive all days of week , for exsample on monday in bologna from 8.30a.m. to 6.30p.m. it-s not apermitted to drive . It-s a very huge problem also drive in particulary time , because you spend a lot of time in traffic jum , for exsample when you go to work , and maybe after a long time spends in your car you have to spend more time leave it , because you don-t find parking .  I hope for all these reasons , that in twenty years everything will change . Perhaps in the futere in each town there will be a metro station a good train and bus station , so all the people can may use not their car but the pubblic trasports . In the big cities there is now a pubblic trasport , but every often is not	ITA
Although my job is a kind of advertiser , I have to say , yes , this problem happens daily .  It 's not difficult for us to find some shampoo advertising on the TV , after used that brand of shampoo , your hair become , woo , shining , beauty and fantasic . Unfortune , when I use that brand , the magic did n't happen to me .  For lots of reasons , advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  First important reason is , when the clients believe the advertisement , the will buy the the produce . The producer can earn much more money than before . A little over than fact , nothing big deal .  Then , lack of manage from the goverment . Some medical and food advertisements , the effects are different from the advertising , the end-users canl be hurt or even dead . But some product have n't been challenged yet , still producting without the goverment 's control .  As a person work on advertising , I know this situation need to be changed . With my workmate , we always try to persude our clients-the producer to accept the advertising concept `` The advertisement , the real fact '' .  We can believe , with the more goverment 's and all people 's support , no one buy these products , no benifits , the problem can be sloved .	CHI
I think that both lifes are so much different from each other . Young people live in a completly different world . And the idea of `` enjoying life '' that old people have , most of the times is not even close to what young people consider `` Enjoying life '' All depends on what is your own idea of living the life , for some poeple no matter young or old , the idea of `` Enjoying the life '' can be partying all the time , on the other hand for other people it can be , raising a family .  The differences between a young person and an old person are so big . Those two different groups have different styles of living ; and even in those groups there are many different sub-groups .  These differences are based on what you believe or think . Sometimes the defferences between a young guy and an old person might be few .  Let 's just say that the life of a young person goes around his college , his friends , partying , and basicly doing what they do , they would n't be able to do no longer when they grow up .  And in my opinion the old people 's life goes around having peace , and most of the time around family . We all know there are young and old people who do not enjoy their lifes at all , they have a pretty much boring life .  We all know that young people are always getting in troubles , they are always having issues and complaining about evertything . But now if we just stop a moment and think for a second , what moves old people 's life in my opinion is young people 's life . Just like cops , in most part of their jobs they have to deal with teenagers .  And Who is always there to get us out of troubles ? Yes , old people .  As a conclution I can , say that both young and old poeple can enjoy their lifes . As a young guy , my idea of enjoying the life is : studying , partying , and basicly hanging out with friends . But also I know old people who share my idea of enjoying the life . I jus trutly believe that my time to enjoy the life in some way is now , after this will come a different style to enjoy my life .

I believe that one that wants to be succesful and that wants to achieve many goals is the one that tries new ways , ideas , and things in life . Without trying or experiencing new ways , one will not learn or be successful in life , because one will not have the ability to achieve new things , and technology would n't have been so great as it is now a days .  For example , without scientists we would n't have ways to study , and experiments to learn about in school . Scientists would n't have learned and invented all those theories without trying and experimenting .  Another example would be if one wants to achieve good business , one would n't achieve it without trying new ways and ideas to make his business grow bigger and better .  Another reason for this statement would be that without experiencing and trying new things , technology would n't have been as great as it it these days , and people would just be doing things they are use to , and would n't have the chance to experience new things in life . Technology is getting bigger and better everyday , with the help of scientists and all other people that try to make new things and more developed things from things that were nothing .  I completely agree with the statement , because as i said above without experiencing , trying , and learnig . nothing would have been invented , learned , or used now a days , and people would just be doing what they are used	ARA

I gree that the most adverxistment makes products seem mach better than they really are or following reaseons .  first i believe that the advertisements is the best way for traders to show there products and services .  I dis agree sime times if the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . because some poeple will buy this product and they will know that this product is not useful as they think .  the big market make this advertisments to get more many and to make the market famous .  finally , many poeple I think its market cheap sale because small , but this not true . society I like go shopping in any way and sale not expensave .  news support imagnation and develop brain , so I hear agood repeate about this decrame .

I agree with the following statement because as the number of cars are too many nowadays , people are looking for some new ways in order to decrease the bad consequences of the car industry and as a result decreasing the number of cars .  First let 's talk about the bad consequences of the car industry . As the number of cars increase day by day this increase leads to traffic problem . One has to spend at least one hour in order to reach his destination . This creates a stress in the person and eventually the person gets more agressive towards everything . As a result the person gets unhappy and his efficiency for working decrases by half each day . Try to imagine this situation happening to the most members of the sociey ! The second problem is the car accidents , each day we hear about car accidents just because of people not obeying the traffic rules and killing each other . Imagine also the physcological effects of all these accidents on the society . The third problem is the air polution . Becase nowadays there are too many cars all around , this creates a problem of pollution . Espeacially in the big cities , it is a very usual thing to smell the gas getting out of the cars which is very unhealthy of course .  So as a result of all these problems that are mentioned in the previous paragraph , people are looking for some new ways in order to increase the efficiency of transportation and as a result decreasing the bad effects of the car industry . In each country people are trying to develop their railroads . By the help of this , traffic can be avoided and people can reach to the places that they want to in a shorter time . This will avoid the stress in people and they can peacefully travel . Also in some countries people are encouraged to use bicycles which according to my mind is a very efficient way . Because it helps relieving stress and also it is healthier for one 's body .  As a result as the number of cars and it 's effects are becoming more and more disturbing for the people , they are looking for new ways in order to solve this problem . By the help of railroads and by the help of bicycle roads people will eventually stop using cars and as a result in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .	TUR
I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . From my point of view it is very important to have people within a society who try to do new things . This is especially important when it comes to innovation . Up to now there would not be any automobile or plain if people did not try to do new things allthough these things were connected to high risks . On the one hand society needs inventions but on the other hand you need to have a look at the risks aswell . Regarding Albert Einstein and his inventions everybody would agree that he created huge value for our society . On the other hand the question must be raised if nuclear weapons existed today if he would not have been that innovative .  As most people are part or member of a community or a company , I would like to focus my answer to the strategic management of a company within a highly competitive market . From my point of view the only possibility to be successful and to create sustainability is to be innovative and to have innovative employees . Of course there are a few companies staying in the market by focussing on their key competences and by `` doing what they already know how to do well '' but to become `` successful '' as mentioned in the question you have to be innovative . Of course one could say that a company focussing on only one well known activity does not have any risk but from my point of view the risk is to get kicked out of the market by another very innovative company .  There is a famous statement referring to the strategic management of a company and its employees which can be used for all other people as well : `` Often it is more important to do the right things than to do things right '' . I draw the conclusion that people trying new things are successful allthough they must be aware of the risks .	GER
In my opinion it is better to specialize in a specific subject or area instead having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , although it can be argued that a general education is also necessary .  Most obviously the goal of all academic education is to ultimatly give us specific knowledge and educate us in a particular area or subject . It is the reason why we go to University after secondary school . Being a professional and knowing one subject thoroughly gives us many advantages on the job market by giving us appeal to customers , clients and future employers . After completing my undergraduate studies I plan to get a master 's degree in law and study one specific area of the Law . In today 's market , professionals are getting more and more specialized because there are so many changes , and so many topics and subjects to study . When a client is having a divorce they will not go to a surgeon or a a coporate lawyer , they will go to a lawyer who specializes in matrimonial action , because he is more likely to help him , after seing so many clients in the same situation .  Further it is not time sensitive to cover many academic subjects and know them all . Some people have more than one degree and spend their life studying and going to one school after another . They know about economic , finance or banking but it is not possible to know them all very well . In addition it can cost a lot to study so many subjects and at the end not being able to compete with one person who spent less time in school but only knows one subject .  Finally It is impossible to learn many subjects and know them all well . It is a sign of lack of stability and indecision . Some students spend their College years changing from one major to another and they can never decide which one to study . So they end up spending years in School and get discourage by the time to graduate and quit school In sum specializing in one subject is the best choice for me , although I would also like to learn about other complementary disciplines like languages sports and art and be able to exchange intelectually with other people .

I agreed with the statement , because when the student understand the ideas and concepts with clear examples in class more information the student retaint in time , and then the student can use this ideas and concepts in the near future and in the far future . I thinks this because I use this principle all time during my studing life , and in my profesional life , in fact many time I use information adquired in my first years of university in special topics of biology and chemestry , matters that I not use normally in my work . Another point is when a student understand ideas and concepts , the studet can use this ideas and concept in relation with others , to understad new know , or made theory about unknow topics , and this is very important in the creation of new concept or the developmewnt of the science and ingeniery . Is more , is the base of the evolution of the society , when more ideas or concept understand the studen best development have in the studies and in the futre work .  For another hand , if the student learn facts is more difficult to the student made relationship between different facts , because is possibilite they don-t have a clear relation , and normally to find a relationship between fact is necesarie ideas and concetp to help to find the relation .

I agree and disagree at the same time . Some of these product are good and some of them are no good .  For example cars . Most of cars adverting are really so nice and good . Half of these cars I do not like . Like Korean cars and french cars . They do not live long . When driving them you do not have a lot of control in case of any dengoures thing happen . And most importantly they are too expensive to buy one of these cars . In the other half there are German and America cars . I love driving one of these types of cars . They have a lot of nice options . A lot of computer that involves . In the high ways you can go as fast as you can and you have almost a total control of it ( I wrote almost becuse nothing is totally a hundred persent ) . One thing I want to montion that most of the German cars are too expensive . So the advertisments for these cars are worth it and truthful .  Let us see some other products that advertisements make them look better on TV than the real life . And that is food . I like most kinds of food . From cold food to hot food . Wither it is spicey or not I do not care . I will eat it . I like Italian food . I am in love with Chineas food . I do not mind Mixecan food . I mentiond that becuse if I see a comercail on a TV about any type of food or a big picure of a hamburger on the wall that says come and taste it . I have to try it then I deside weather the advertisements of this type of food is good or not .  In the end Advertissing aggences are really smart doing what they do .	ARA
I think , the main point of inventing is curiosity . I absolutaly agree with this statement . Succesful people try new things and take risks rather tahn only ding what they already know how to do well . There are many charecteristics that make a person successful . Tenecity and intellenge are only two of these .  F ? rstly , if a person has tenacity , he/she never gives up , never accepts ` no ' for an answer . He/she studies hard to succeeds his/her goal . He is curious about his target . He does his best to achieve his goal for this target . He is so willing to learn new informations and making new inventions . For example , one of the great genious of our worlds is Einstein . He was a big inventor . And we are still using his theories in our classes . I think he gather his ambitions , intellegence and tenecity and form a person who will not be forget at any time of the world .  Secondly , intellegence is a vey important factor that makes a person successful . If a person is intellegent , He/she can understand the problems easyly and does his/her best to cope with it . If people in our worlds do not be curious about new inventions , nothing could be found . For example , tecnology can not be improved widely , beneficial investigations about our era 's diseas cancer can not be found . These are all beneficial to human beings .  To sum up , nothing can be done without risking anything . The world is improving rapidly . People must always learn something to cope with these changes . They mustnot be frighten of the new improvement and new tecnology . Also , they must think ` what must I do to improve myself ' instead of doing well what they already know . They have to do this not only for theirselves , also for the beneficial of all people around world .	TUR
I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to merely learn facts . The following points can be reasonably made to support the above statment .  To begin with , understanding of ideas and concepts enables one to really appreciate the mechanics of it and to possibly put the idea or concept into application . Take the example of an electric motor . Without proper understanding of how an electric motor really works , it is impossible for one to create motors of various sizes and for various utilities . If one mearly learnt the facts about a motor , we would n't have all the pleasures in life made possible by all the miniature motors ! Look at the cars power windows , whose operation is facilitated by small motors , or at many of useful the robots whose motion is made possible by various sizes/types of motors , or at many of the precision tools that use something called stepper motors to precisely control various operations .  Further , understanding of a concept enables one to look for ways the concept can be extended to other applications , or to find ways two or more concepts can be combined to come up with new ideas that make exciting things possible . Take the example of a device that scans printed material and converts it into typed matter on a computer . This device is the result of a lot of different concepts put together . The scanning technology - which scans the printed material , which is then combined with pattern matching technology - that can look at the scanned picture and recognize the letters based on their shapes . Simple learning of facts does n't really allow for this kind of innovations .  However , no one can deny the role facts play in helping people visualize things and in putting things in perspective . Take for example the Saturn rocket that took man to the Moon . Unless one knows the size of the rocket , the amoount of fuel used , how many inventions were required to make the flight possible , one may not really appreciate the scale of the device and the project . But one can still see that the facts help one gain a perspective of things , but the really usefulness comes only when one understand the concepts that make it possible for the device to work .  In summary , it is clear that it is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn just facts , despite the important role played by the facts .	TEL
Successful people have different ways and strategies to be unique and successful among the others . The main ways of successful are either , by taking the risks or by doing and applying what they already know or plan for . The two types of people might consider different factors in their living environment that will guide them to the best succeeding path or way .  People who like to take risks , their surrounding evironment forces them or encourage them to take the risks . Their environment might be poor , tough , or has a lot of shortages so this will let them search for new and creative ways to satisfy their needs , and these ways mostly risky because no one have ever tried their ways before . An example for this , is the inventors case . Inventors taked the risk to tried risky or unfamiliar procedures to come up with a unique , new usaable invention that turned their life into the sucessful life . Another example is a company owner , who will take a risky decision to solve an wanted or sudden market conditions .  People who like to do what they planned for , are usually have a stable life and environment . They go through regular path as any one else , but they do more effort and plan wisely to achieve their predetermined goals . Most of people from this type do not like to take risk before making an intensive analysis for all the consecutive results for taking any risk . As a result they will end up with not changing their plans . An example of this , are people who does not like to change their career . Or the people who take the same path as their fathers or mothers , for example being a doctor or professor in the college same as their parents .  In my opinion I like to do what I already planned for , with out taking the risk . Because it is more safer for my career and social position , also I do not have the strong ability to find alternative solutions in case of failure of any risky action . More over it is more convenient for me to live in the same pattern through my life with a reasonable improvement same as the average people . I also strongly consider my stable life that does not force me to take any risk .	ARA
People think that it is smart that you know everything . However , human ' s ability is limited . Sometimes you need to be concerned about what you are really capable of . Some people do well on one specific subject some people on another , so i think that it is very good to have broad knowledge but not all the time . When you really think about it , if we specialize in one specific subject we would have more time to do it , and also we 're more expert in it .  When we focus on one thing , we could spend more time on it than when with the other thing so interrupting . It 's like that . People do not have two seperate spirit . Once we were interrupted , we might lose the important parts that we had been focused on . It would be too hard for normal people .  Secondly when we specialize in a specific subject , we have more attention on it . We would n't be confused with two things . That way we remember more informations from that things we studied .  Lastly there is always something that we 're good with and not food with . For example maybe i 'm really good at playing tenis but once it goes on the table like ping-pong i totally messed up , because it is natrual . I were born this way . People ca n't forced me to do it , because that does n't do any good either .  Being an expert on one specific thing makes life less confusing . However , I 'm not saying those smart guys who knows everything is n't smart enough to make lifeeasier . it 's just i like it	CHI
Let me introduce first . I am from Japan and have grown up there . I totally agreed with that yong people recently do not give enough time to helping their communities . The some reasons why young people does not are that in Japanese society , there are more interests , such as playing video games and interuption like busy for studying . Or the young people tend to not have any interests to others .  Most of elderly people said `` a long time ago of young people have sufficient time for helping their communities . '' However , time is always changing , therefore , youth does not want to help or not like their communities at all . Even if their parents may be not care of those communities , so they might not to push their sons or daughters going to communities .  On the other hand , because Japanese are studying so harder than playing , and some of youth has to focus on studying instead of helping the communities , so they do not have time to go communities . Not only Japanese study so hard , but also does Asian study very hard if we compare between Asia and North America .  Americans may have enough time to helping their communities because I saw young Americans by using my eyes . Also , I heard from my friends who are Americans that Japanese are studying hard than Americans . It means that Japanese do not have time to helping their communities .  In Japan , there are one of the worst booms for young people . We called the boom : `` Hikikomori Phenominon . '' Young Japanese ( young adults too ! ) tends to stay at their houses , especirooms , and spend time there in a whole day . It means that they do not have any interests outside of the world . They never work for job , go to school , and never going out .  In conclusion , the reasons why in recent years young people do not have time to spend are changing period , busy for studying , and bad phenominon .	JPN
There are two way for training to work and to live . One of these is speecializing in one specific subject , the other is studying in order to have a broad knowledge . In my opinion each of these ways has some advantagesand some disadvantages , but the second is the best .  As regards the first possibilty , that is having a specific knowledge , I think that the most important advantage is that who has a specific education , have a high possibility to find a job , a well rewarding job , in the field where he or she studies in depht . Indeed , nowadays , firms and companies , look for people who can give a sensible help to the firm . Students well prepared are a competitive factor that allow firms to gather much money .  On another hand , people or students who have a wide range of interests , who study different subjects , have the possibility to use the informations they gather during their training in order to create a good social life . Moreover I think that these people are more flexible in change their work during their life .  For these reasonss , even if at first view , the first kind of knowledge could seem better , I think that , expecially in the liong time , for example during the whole life , the second kind of knoledge is more useful for people .  I think so , because I chose to study a subjet in depht , that is management engineering , and I study this subject in depht for making myself more competitive that the others students in the world of job . Whene I have some free time I prefer not to spend it in reading because I 'm very tired for my work at university . But when I meet people studing something different from economical , mechanical or industial subjects , and I talk with them about something they have discussed in class or they have read in a magazine I alway feel that I 'm incomplete , my education is incomplete , because even if I 'm clever I have n't the basic informations to say my opinion about the topic . So I think that everyone should be spend part of the day to read magazine , journal and so on in order to have a rewarding life .	ITA
Nowadays students have lost their interest on the procedence of ideas and concepts . As time goes on , there are fewer students interested in answering questions such as `` How Newton 's law was conceived and what is its mathematical basis ? '' or `` how steel was first created from its natural constituents ? ''  Students are loosing that curiosity in how facts are conceived due to lack of interest in things they think already exist and do not need to be studied again by them because it was already clarified centuries ago by someone else . Insteed they rather learn and understand the final results obtained years ago , which have been put under evaluation several times through all these years .  To explain further this point , let us take a look at the two examples mentioned at the beginning of this essay : Newton 's law . Back in Isaac Newton 's time it surely was surely important to prove his second law of motion by measuring the time a body lasts in free falling motion frorm a determined height . Nowadays students do not care for proving this theory by implementing their own experiments : they rather studied the formula developed by Newton and applied it in a physics problem with only one purpose : to get a good degree at the end of the course .  Now let us take a look at the second example : the manufacture of steel . There is a big theory on this field and research is still carried out on it . Many cultures were involved in the early years or the iron era , and a lot of experiments were carried out to study how iron reacted with air to produce steel : many manufacturing thecniques were studied to come with the idea of using high temperature furnaces to produce steel . This last result is the one that matters for students ; they are only interested in understanding how steel is formed in a chemical reaction in order to get a good grade once again . They do not care on proving themselves that steel can be manufactured in such ways .  The reason why students act this way has already been mentioned : they are told to wory only about a degree , and they are not allowed to let the minds think about what they really like . It would be better if students were allowed to study what they really like . In this way , a students who really likes chemistry and physics will be surely wondering about the facts , while a student who wants to developed an artistic talent such as painting , does not have to worry about things he does not really care .

I agree with this statement . In my opinion being successul requires you to be uncommon . You need to have some unique qualities in order to be recognised and acknowledged by public . Repeating the same things you in which you have acquired perfection might earn you attractive results initially but in the long run they are n't much fruitful . The competion in all fields of life is very tough these days . So to overtake others you need to possess some distinguishing charecteristics . Working on a same project again and again is not going to solve your purpose . Because gradually other people also acquire mastery over them and may even surpass you . Though trying to do new things , say , for example starting a new business may ultimately turn out to be a disaster and in that context the other view appears to be more appropriate but as we all know ` failures are the stepping stones to success ' . History is full of instances that support the idea of endeavouring new things . One common example is of scientists . Its well known that only those who have tried to innovate have been able to register their names in the books and are remembered even after hundreds of years . What if Einstein had accepted the already running theories ? The concept of relativity would have never arose and of course Einstein could n't have been able to get the noble prize . There are numerous other examples of various leaders , businessmen , researchers who became successful only because they tried to introduce new concepts . To name a few , Mahatma Gandhi who pioneered Indian freedom movement , businessmen like Bill Gates who intoduced windows and revolutionised the computer industry and now he stands as the richest man on earth . So based on above mentioned examples and facts i am of the opinion that only those succeed who do new things and take risk	HIN
People who take risks are more likely to receive benefits from their actions rather than people that simply do n't act . This is not only a logical assumption but it is also supported by evidences which are true at global scale . Some of the richest people in the world were ordinary people with very good ideas . An example for that is Bill Gates . Instead of improving existing tools , he decided to project and invent a new instrument , the personal computer , which will cause a revolution in work and entertainment activities . He risked to waste many years of work on something uncertain that could just be a failure . It is now clear that he had employed his time in a very fruitful manner and that he will be remembered as a genius .  On the other hand , some people succeeded in exporting good ideas to other countries with different cultural backgrounds . A good example is Starbucks coffee which is now sold all over the world and even in China . It must have been a very controversial decision to take for the managers . But , although the chinese society is traditionally used to tea instead of coffee , now many Chinese young people drink Starbucks coffee to identifiy with American models .  On smaller scale we all can experiment that if we take some risks we will have more chances to fulfill our desires and be more happy . For example , you can decide to go and study in the United States . At the beginning it will be difficult because of the language constraints and the distance from family and friends . But if you hold on and overcome difficulties you will get a valuable degree from an excellent university that will allow you to access to better job and income opportunities .  In conclusion , I think it is always worthy to try new things and take risks . We need to remember that we are given only one opportunity in this world and we should do our best to be happy and make other people happy .	ITA
Nowadays , cars are major means of transport . They have been used for over 100 years . Somehow , people are now addicted to cars . It has become an essential thing in our everyday life .  Besides , it 's unlikely that people get rid of that mean of transport . There is always something new to learn , to discover . Cars might be technologically advanced in twenty years , but i hardly think there will be fewer cars in use . In saudi arabia , people tend to use more and more cars , as every single family has , in average , 2 cars .  Actually , cars need maintenance , energy , fuel . The only reason that could lead to the decreasing use of cars are the unsuffiecient quantity of petroleum . As we all know , that ressource is limited on the Earth , and we could run out of fuel in 50 years .  However , the human being is known to be solution finder : we could probably invent new cars that work on another energy , for example the sun energy . Actually , some of these cars are being tested all over the world . That suggests the fact that there is always a solution for every problem .  In my opinion , i think cars are very useful , even though they make air pollution . It has served the man for centuries . But , eventually , if there is no more petroleum , cars are useless . That natural factor could be the major reason of the usingless of that mean of transport .  In conclusion , that statemnet is wrong if there is not that natural factor that stops us from providing energy to make our cars work .	ARA
The answer to this question depends of the situation that a particular person is at a time . In the case that the person does not know the city or place that is being visited , I would recomend to contract a tour guide and doing it in a group because he is going to take you to the most important places in a quick , safe and with all the explanations needed to know the place that you are visiting , and also you can enjoy the company of other people , giving you the oportunity to meet and share experiences . One of the most important things when you are traveling is to see the culture of the place , for example the food , dances , festivals , etc. and I think that a tour guide can help you to accomplish this goal , also the tour guide can give you historical information about the place which is very important when trying to understand the way the residents of the region visited behave .  On the other hand I think that if you have been before in the region and specially if you have been there for a couple times , hiring a tour giude is a waste of money and time , because this kind of services are usually expensive and you can use that money in something more productive in you trip , also the tour guide is going to take you to places where you have already been . Instead of that you can use that time to visit new places of the region , doing something different than your last visit .  So the conclusion for this is that it depends based on you previos experience on visiting the region . I will absolutly recomend so in the case that it is you first time , but if you have been before I do not see any reason to take a tour .	SPA
There are many different reasons that make me think that in the twenty years to come , we wo n't use cars as much as we do today .  On one hand , we do have to remember that most cars need gas to go ahead . And gas comes from oil , whose quantities on our planet is definitely not endless . As it is getting harder and harder , and so more and more expensive to extract oil , the prices of all of its associated products will increase so much that we wo n't be able to afford them in a close future . Therefore , unless we find out other sources of energy as efficient as gas , we should enjoy driving as long as we still can fuel our cars and before it turns into a luxury !  On the other hand , using gasoline as a fuel for our cars contributes to pollute the environment . We are likely to get into troubles very soon if we do not stop polluting so much and each of us has to take his responsabilities in this major issue . As a matter of fact , we are talking here of the Mankind 's survival ! We need to be more sensible , at for our children !

I agree with that , it is more important for studets to understand ideas and cocept thanit is for them to learn facts . I believe in this because I think the idea and the concept of anything is more important than the fact especially in some subjects like technology , philosphy , mathmetics , becaues here you have to analys the fact using the ideas and the conepts . So that the indeas and the concepts are important to understand and analys the fact it self .  First , most of the subjects that we are studing in the school are based on fact , but our understanding for this subject will not completed if we do n't know the concepts and the ideas about this fact . For instance if we are studing acourse about the structure of the air plane , here we are studying the fact of the air plan , but if we also studying the idea why we are using this material or putting this thing in this place this will give us have a wider view about the mechanisme how we could make the air plane flying with the most perfict and efficiant way . For exampl we use the Aluminium instead of Iron to made the skeleton of the air palne because it is lighter . This is an important concept we should know it about the structure of air plane ,  Second the idea and the concept is more important than the fact in analysing the mathematical problems . If we want to solive any problem we have to know the idea and the concept of this problem . If we only know the fact we will never reach the solution . because in mathemathic we depend on the facts as well as on the ideas and the concept to analyis these facts .  Finally , concepts and idea are important in our life philosphy . Philosphy of life is depended on facts . but we need to understant the concept of this facts . For exampl , there is a fact in our life is that every one of us should get married , but we have to understand the concepts and the ideas of marrige . Here the concept is more important because we should get married not just becuse it is a natural desire but because the human bieng is a social animal and must live with a partner and has a children in order to be happy .

As i am a advanture liking person , i does not agree this statement . to enjoy any tour that must be in group but that need not to be guided by any guide. reasons for my this thinking are as follows :  Firstly , guide is a professional person . His aim will be only one and that is to make his coustmer go arround the each of the visiting point without giving the time to enjoy that place fully . If we all friends together can make our own way by our own .  Secondly , without a guide you can travel by your own convenience .  For example , last month i was gone to a tour for Bombay ( boolywood city ) , Lonavalla and Khandala ( tourist places ) with my collage friends . These places are very beautiful and full of natural scence . Over there we had hire a guide to take us to different places . That guide rounded all the places within one and a half hour . many places were there to which he shown us from a long distance . I and my friends requested him to spent fraction of time over every places ,, but unfortunatly he doesnot allowed . Our bad luck .  But for another example , Last year me with my relatives gone to the tour without the guide . The place was definatly unknown to us . But by our own afforts we reached to that So i donot prefer to have a guied on tour .	HIN
Cars are used as the primary form of personal transportation all across the world today . Twenty years down the line , they will continue to do so .  The population is increasing day by day , and there seems to be no sign of the population growth slowing down . Higher population figures implies more poeple needing personal transportation , and with existing technology , the cars are the best answer to that .  There is a need for transportation , there is a proven technology which is not only currenlty popular , but also developing day by day - `` Cars '' would thus continue to grow , even twenty years down the line .  Fossil fuels , the primary source of energy for ` cars ' is more than abundant over the next twenty years , and with the abundant energy source , the demand for cars would not reduce .  Hybrid technology to drive cars with more fuel effecient and less polluting fuels would give a boost to the car industry and people would have one more reason to buy a car .  Other advancements in technology , especially in safety and drive quality would also fuel the demand for transportation . This would only help put more cars on the road now , and twenty years down the line .  Unless some alternative transportation developed , tested and proven within the next twenty years - say anti-gravity saucers or teleportation a-la ' star trek , cars and ground vehicles would continue to be preffered .  Fact is that the human population growing and will continue to grow twenty years down the line . With this the need for transportation and the demand for personal transportation equipment will also grow .  The car with proven technology and new advancements will continue to provide personalised transportaion well into the future . Moreover , driving a car is now an integral part of human culture , like riding a horse . The cars were our answer to the needs to transportation sixty years ago , and they will continue to be twenty more years from now .	TEL
I disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' , because I think that when you travel and you want to see new things is better to have your own time and to manage your time acording to your preferences and your needs . Sometimes when you are traveling and you have to be whit a guide and with a group of people , you dont have enogh time to look at the things you like , to analize the things you see , or the time to enjoy the thing you like best . For example , for me is very important not only to see the monuments and learn about the history of a place , but to teast the food of the place I 'm visiting , and to have time to talk with the people that live their . In conclution I believe that not everybody has the same interests when their are traveling , and that many times a good book can replace a guide , it is only a matter of reading about the pleace your visting . So I would recomend to buy a good book , look for information in the internet , and then take all your time to do the things you really like , to enjoy your trip .	SPA
I agree with the comment that the yonger people now a days do not give enough time for helping their communities . This could be a result of many reasons . Helping the community is a part of every persons duty . In improveing their community they would tend to improve their surroundings and their quality of living .  For example , if there is a need for some good social workers for their communities they would not have much of their intrest in such a kind of aspects because they are busy with their work tensions . They would rather spend their time enjoying in some play groud or a film theater rather in doing some social work for their community . The younger generations now a days would prefer to stay out of halping their communities to develop because they are intrested in some other aspects . They would less concentrated on halping their community because some ego feelings which their fellow collegues would never do . They are very busy with their academic career that they do not have much time left for helping communities .  It would not be the problem of the educational institutions for having such a tight schedule of academics . But it would be the sheer intrest of the younger people to have the community . It would be their personnel intrest for helping the community . Like wise there are very few younger people who would rather show some intrest in helping community . It would be the older people who would like to help more rather than the younger people because they have no work tensions . It would be rather correct to say they have much less work tensions rather than the younger people . So they would surely have some advantage over the younger people in helping their community .  In conclusion , i would like to say that the younger people have very much less time for helping the community when compared to the older people . It would help the community grow faster if the younger people show some intrest in their community because they are much more energetic and enthusiastic then the older people .	TEL
As the knowledge about science is expanding , specialization is the result of this expanding . A man can read a lot about a subject but this will be his habbits about an topic . This is the Filling of spare time , A man can only do on thing or job well but has lot of habbits .  Spesification about medicine could be the example . The medical knowledge we have reached today is enormous . A medic can not have all the subjects about medicine experienced . As it is so , it will be superficial and will have less benefit for his or her patients . Thats why medics try to graduate on paediatrics , oncology or cardiovascular surgery . As you uppergraduate on any subgroup , you should know that subject more deeply .  But as stated in the first passage , A man can only do one job well , the habbits of him also has supporting effects on his job . As a result , a man also needs habbits , that will support his job . As a result , for this century , spesification is highly required for benefit .	TUR
I believe that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because when it comes to facts even though some people believe that it is the truth and that it will never change others do not . Take me for an example , I come from an egyptian background . In my culture they believe certain things that they call `` facts '' but I do not believe most of the `` facts '' that they believe in .  I was born in the United States but my parents sent me back and forth from Egypt to America so i have lived here and there . One of the `` facts '' that they believe in is that a young women should not move out of her parents apartment if she is not married . they also believe this concept that they call `` fact '' even though if she is going to live on campass so he/she can continue her education . This idea is not a fact even though some people believe that it is including my parents . When i tried talking to them about it they tell me how its a fact and how it is not an idean or a concept because it has been going on for the past years .  Another thing that I believe is an idea and my egyptian culture calls it a `` fact '' is that an egyptian can not marry a non-egyptian they have to marry an Egyptian and when I ask why they respond with an answer like this `` that is how it is '' . When they respond with an answer like that why should I believe it is a fact not a concept ? When I lived in Egypt they used to tell me a men can marry a non-egyptian but a women can not and when I asked why ? they told me because when you have kids then they become what their dad is for example if their dad is an etiopian then they become that if he is christian then the kids become that but i do not believe that because you become who you are not , not who your parents are .

Depending on personal experience , personality type and emotion concern , different people have different ideas about which people enjoy life most . Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . While others do not agree . In my opinion I think young people do enjoy life more than older people do . Yes , older people may have more money , more experiences , but can not make the time back . But for the young , everything in the world is new and fresh , so they can have plenty time the expercience and enjoy the life more than the older people .  First of all , the young people have plenty time and passion the study the new konwledge and every thing that just happen in the world . By this way , they can stay in fashion and enjoy the life more , You see , according the suvey maded by the China Daily , few of the people older than 50 using computer to work and communicate with others , which is a more money-saving and interesting way to do things . So we must say that it is the young can enjoy the life more Second lly , I think the young people have more time and energy to have funs . They are young and strong , they can have a lot of great activities that the older people can have . In this ways , we can see that theyoun people can have more entertamians . I am a young girl now , and I think I can do every thing if like , I am planing to travel around the world someday in the future . See I think few older can have such a dream . and in this way , I would to say , yound people do enjoy life more than older people .  Addtionally , young people usually healther than older people . There is famous old saying in China , Health in the basic of everything you want to do . and because young people have strong body , they can enjoy the life more than older people .  From the statements above , you can obvious see that young people have more chance and more time and more energy and more passion to lead a better life . In a summit , I stongly agree the opinion that young enjoy life more than older people .	CHI
How many are there commercials between TV programs ? People are aware that those are main sources of TV broadcasting companies to get a lot of profit . I think that most advertisements make people buy their products without sensible judgement by enlarging the product qualities . There are two specific examples regarding the purposes of advertisements .  First , various media can be a good method to assure that producs are flawless . Many products usually are advertised by famous people having a good image . If those products are shown to people repetitively , nobody would be doubtful about the qualities of them .  Second , almost all of the companies do n't mention the side effects of their products aside . They have only to emphasize the advantages of things to users . Because it is more profitable to close their items ' faults .	KOR
I agree with the statement that successful people are more adventurous and brave than ordinary people .  It takes a lot of effort and time to be successful . The succeful people try new things starting with established knowledge and beliefs . In order to be considered successful , one needs to practice beyond what is perceived ordinary and common . By experimenting new things based on common knowledge and beliefs , one can be able to find a new ways to reach or meet what is demanding beyond the common practice .  The successful people also do not afraid of taking risks . They are further brave than ordinary people . They try new things that enables them to find a solution that others have not yet found by doing things in common ways .  To be considered successful , one needs to have creative perspective and exceptional mindset in viewing a society . Such a character can only be built by by trying new things in spite of making errors and taking risks . Without adventuring risks and trials , one is only considered to be ordinary and common .	KOR
The success of people is strictly related to the level of risk taken . The real success is the materialization of the people 's ability to differentiate themself respect to other . A good example of success story could be the Steve Jobs adventure in the technological world . Steve Jobs , that is the father and the creator of the apple company , know very well , that to be a successful man , you must take some risk , and try to do the things in a different way respect your competitors .  As Professor Porter says the real and most valuable competitive advantage for a company , but at the same time for a person , is the ability to be different . Be different , not mean , only doing new things ; be different could be doing the old things but in different way .  Every time that we try to do a new things , we take at the same time more risks , but to be successful , we must be able to evaluate the differents risks , and to figure out what could be our return , and what or in which measure the failure could affect our life .  Then , from my point of view , success is related with a multiple series of different factors : ability to create , to immagine , or to perform something in different way respect to other people ; predisposition to the risk , in other words , could be very difficult reach the success , if the subject is a risk adverse ; but at the same time , is very important , the ability to measure this risk , and to create some different scenarios , to be able to predict what could happen if everything take the wrong path . Returning to the Steve Jobs example , what signed the success of the apple company , was the visionary ability of Jobs , in figuring out what will distingue a product like ipod from a different mp3 device . He choosed an innovative path , he calculated and evaluated the risks correlated with his ideas , and , reaching some failure , taking some lose , he finally succed with his device .  Then , when someone have success , is at last , cause he was able to understand and to learn from his failure and his errors , that could derive from trying to be different , and taking some risks .  Success is in my opinion , the prize , reserved to who have the courage to be like no others .	ITA
Advertisements penetrate into every aspects of our lives conveying messages that a particular product is superior than the other or try to forge a need to buy a particular item . In order to realize this goal , they represent the product far superior than it really is . Hence , today the image of the product exceeds the practicle use of it in terms of importance and its practicle use .  What advertisements offer is therefore a status remark and a definition for a person 's identity . The item describes the its owner in the particular way that the advertisements load them with . For example , a diet coke is never just a simple drink that would cut back your thirst or accompany some food . Rather , it is an item that turns its consumer into someone attractive , lean and one that know how to live well . Even the label that your pencil bears on it would transmit a message about who you are just just because the advertisements ' way of representing it . You can be a hardworking and determinant indiviudual or even someone rebellious .  In this sense , I agree that advertisements render products much better than they really are . They shift their practicle meaning into a sign for your personal idnetity and status . Thus , they sell not just the item item itself but also the message it entails . In this context , you do not pay a considerable price for a basic item but for something that respresent .	TUR
In my point of view , the mentinoed statement must get a lot of support and I personally agree with the statement saying that products are made to seem much better by advertising than they really are . I belive this speaking from a personal experience . Once I bought a set of roller pens . The specifacations were that those pens wrote in a 0.7 but when I used them , they were not even 0.3 . I think that the problem behind such an issue is the production company . Those companies try to make their products as attractive as they can in order to attract the most consumers .  Those companies forget that once someone buys anything that does much less than it says , it will be returned to the retail selling agent , and the retail selling agent will in return return it to the company where many other items have been returned . The result of this is that the name of the company will not be mush in the market , and will have no future product under the same name . It could be that what they were after is temporar profits . If this is the case , they succeeded . So , exaggerating the product 's description and the exaggeration in claiming that a certain product does certain things , while in reality does not leads the consumers to think about and try the product before they buy it .

In my opinion I think that not true because some young people didnt enjoy they life because they get no money now , and the old people they get more money then the young people , so they can do something different then young people .  The young people they can paly more thing then the old people because they still young and the can do something crazy because they dont even know is that right thing to do or not , so they can do more thing then the old people on this age , also in my opinion i think the old people is more enjoy they life then the young people because now in the new always see the young people they kill themself so i think that the probnlem because the young people dont even know what are they doin or what thing is right to do , and the old people they dont want died in that age because now they get the money to do the thing they enjoy so now they dont need work hard like before now they are free .  I think is depent what kind people they think on they life , because everyone are different , so ca n't say which kind people are mpre enjoy they life or not is you own think to change your mind . ca n't say whichone are more enjoy they lfie .

Young people seems to be more activ and to spend more time to enjoy life than older people . Indeed it seems that young people want to enjoy the present before getting old . But we can wonder if young people really enjoy life more than older people do . In a first part we will examine qrguments in favour of this statement . Then we will interest in the older people in order to conclude on that statement .  Why is it thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do . The first reason is that young people are more activ . They are more dynamic . They have no fear because they are young . They feel invicible . They are in a period of their life where they have dreams and are ready to do anything to realise those dreams . It can be travelling around the world or doing a special carrer . .. An other caracteristic of young people is that they have more free time that they can spend with their friends or doing their hobbies . Because they are young they have less restrictions . ..  It is the reason why they can do what they like . They always find time to do it because they are dynamic . An other reason why they enjoy life is that they discover life since they are young . A lot of things are totally new for them . Finally , people meet their best friends as they are young .  Now , why is it thought that older people enjoy life less than younger people ? The first reason is that older people have a lot of obligations such as a job , a family , children . .. All those things take a lot of time and became sometimes fastidious .  But the matter is to define what does ` enjoy life ' mean . In my opinion , young people enjoy the present instead older people enjoy on a long time	FRE
For many decades professors , politicians , employers , intellectualls and students in Germany have been discussing the question what an academic education should be like : Is it better to educate the student to generalists or specilists ? Some people say that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Although this idea is supported by good arguments , I prefer to specialize in one specific subject .  First , it is better to take a study course in which you are really interested in instead of taking coures in many different academic subjects , because the student can focus on one single topic . If he concentrates on one specific subject , he will finish his study course right in time and will pass his exam with good marks . Taking too many subject courses is very confusing , and a student does not have the time to deal with each single subject in the way he is supossed to be . For example it is very complicated to combine a literary . cultural or media study course with mathematics or ingeneering .  Second , companies nowadays are not interested in generalist , because they need specialist . There are only a few branches where generalists can get a job . Advertisement for jobs in newspaper always give a detailed description of the skills an employee should have . And mostly only a specialist satisfies the companies ' needs .  Therefor specializing on one subject is the best way to get a good job . Finally , being specailized in one specific subject does not prevent you from getting in touch with other academic topics and study courses . If you are good in one topic , you might also deal with other academic subjects that are interesting . But it is vital that you still focus on `` your '' study course .  Taking all this into consideration , I arrive at the conclusion that it is very important to specialize in one specific subject instead of having knowledge of many academic aspects . In some way , we are all generalists . But being a specialist is a unique characteristic that improves your chances to get a good job .	GER
I am agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people . Young people are generally have great verve and energy . whereas , older people can not enjoy the life with such attitude . Young people normally enjoy their life while doing their mundane jobs . But old people will do their jobs by creating unwanted stress around them . The health is wealth . If you are fit and fine then only you can live your life in most hilarious manner . But old people are often surrounded by such kind of ailments pertinent to age , which restrict them to enjoy .  I have great respect for my grand aunt who is inhabitant of our street . I am watching her since I was in 5th class . She was very active and alert at that time . She had little problem because of diabetes , but she had overcome any kind of stress and problem at that time . Now , the canditions had changed . Most of times , she is not even able to walk properly . She is suffering from such kind of ailments which are very painful . Whenever I watch her I can easily undestand the savour of young life . Young people readily overcome most of the ailments because of proper physiological function of their body .  The other factor which make the old people lethagic towads life is , `` Pessimism '' . Old people do not prefer to work after age of 55 or 60 which causes these people sluggish and prone to various dreadful diseases . Young people always ambitious about their career and goals which motivate them to enjoy life rather then to take as a burden .  Young people prefer to socialize and make friends with whom they can go to dance bars , hotels etc . Old people like lonliness . My grand aunt previously was fond of parties and get togathers . But now , she disdain such kind of crowd and prefer to live in disgrunteled canditions . Young people emancipate themselves from all kind of bondages and live life with vivacious attitude . In short , normal functioning of body and optimistic attitude of young people make them so that they can enjoy their life .	HIN
While some poaple thinks that most advertisements make products seem mush less than they real are , I think differ . In my opinion , I thinks that the advertusements make products seem mush better they are , The reason is that advertisement provides business commerce and .  Fist of all , what advertisement means is make a reputation to the company . There is no doubt us that the object of most of companies is earning money . In other words , the image and funtion of products sometimes is better than they really are .  In addition , what advertisement means using effective and effcient ways is to attarct comsumers ' eyes . There is no doubt that the companies devote to their efforte to refresh comsumer 's mind instead of thinking about what real does good to them . No wonder , There are a lot of not thrthful advertisement on the TV , newspaper , and on-line commerce . For example , there are a lot of young ladies want to be more well-shaped . However , they dose n't go go see the doctor to ask for a professional advise . Actuallly , they just buy the madicine on-line . Unfortunately , the medicine are always not the thrth purpose . Moreover , some of them have problems beacause eating them . What 's more , some of them  To sum up , some people believe what they see on the screen , but I think differ. l would rather buy the products l used or my friens suggests me . Thus , it 's a mush more practical and useful to puechase , espacially go shopping .	CHI
Undoutedly I would say that I agree with the statement given here that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .  My first reason is , as we go to a new place , we may not be knowing how the place is , how will the behaviour of the people look , what their culture is , what their customs are , what their tradition is etc . If we go to some Latin American countries , we may find some difficulty in understanding their language and also we ca n't understand their accent even though they speak english . For example , suppose that you planned to go to france , the language the people speak there is French , you may not understand French where you need a guide .  Second reason is , if the place you planned to tour a historic place with out a guide , you finnaly end up with the rocky structers you see there . As each historic place has a history behind it , the main purpose of visit is to know its history , a guide is right person to explain it for you . For example when you go on a tour to Egyptian pyramids , you may not know who build them , how they are build , but if you have a guide with you he can help you explain all these details . After all you derive a lot of thrill and in turn a great happiness by knowing all these details .  On the contrary when you tour alone or with you kith and kin who do n't know anything about either the place or the history you can not enjoy the place just becauce you do n't know the details and there will be every possibility of getting detoured . When you encounter a mysterious inscriptions scribbled on stone you alone on your own can not decode them in order to enjoy the trip to the fullest extent .  Having considered all the reasons given about I would say that I strongly agree with the given statement .	HIN
The older generation sometimes says that the younger generation does not play an active role in helping their communities anymore . They think that the younger generation is selfish and only wants to earn a lot of money . There are a few points supporting this opinion but there are also a few against it .  The first thing to say is that the traditional bonds between the younger and older generation have dissolved nearly completely . E.g. it is not common anymore that both generations live together in one house . Therefore the younger generation can not feel this strong sense of community that once existed . From this on I think that the younger generation is involved in several other activitites to help their communities . First , there are a lot of teenagers who help the church or the local administration , e.g. during elections . I have some friends doing that and I can say that the work they do there is really admirable . Second , there are many teenagers who are involved fighting against environmental problems . These activities are really beneficial to the local community because they help to achive a sustainable lifestyle . The last point is that many students are working hard for school or university . That does not only mean that they want to achive professional success but they also want to improve life at school or university for theirselves and for all other students .  Now let me talk about a point I 've just mentioned : the hard work for school or university . Of course this means that they have to spend a lot of time learning and not directly helping their community . But I think that learning is the best way to achive a good life for the whole community . The young generation knows that without working hard they wo n't be able to achive a good life for their community , e.g. if there are no skilled workers in town economy and finally the whole community will suffer a lot .  Finally you could say that it 's not true that young people today do not spend enough time to help their community . As we 've seen , young people engage in a lot of activities in order to help their community but they do this differently than the generations before .	GER
I find it productive and rewarding to specialize on one subject because one is likely to progress better by staying focused on one area of thought . Mathematicians like Andrew Wiles worked a huge amount of time to prove a single theorem , but he happened to solve one of the greatest enigmas of mathematics . So devoting oneself completely to solve a problem or to structure a method may result in an effective , all-inclusive and creative solution or understanding .  However , specialization could also mean boredom or a waste of time . Staying up all night pursuing the same goal over and over again may cause someone to live an empty life , even to lose focus of what they were looking for in the first place and thereby make many years ' work obsolete . Many great thinkers got stuck in their own minds , thinking there was only one important thing in the world , like religion or fancy metaphysical entities , shutting themselves down from the rest of the world and , more importantly , from the opportunities of growth and understanding they had as human beings . The mind has to flow and explore , take new chances , it is not contained in a box . After all , there are many ideas and projects out there , endless possibilities of how to make a better world . A wide range of abilities and knowledge of various subjects enriches people 's lives and opens their minds . The only problem is that it is difficult to coordinate oneself to grow in each discipline , one can get easily distracted and it is hard to determine what requires one 's attention at what time .  Still , the statement could be wrongly put forward . Going back to Wiles 's experience , he could not have proved the theorem without having a wider mathematical understanding , if he had n't looked in archives others ( more specialized mathematicians ) would have considered useless or out of the subject , if he had n't dared to try new methods whenever it was needed , Nowadays it is hard to think what it would be like to focus on only one discipline or science , since they are all related with each other , and with technology , in significant ways .

I definately agree with the statement that it would be more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn the facts . To support my opinion I will give three reasons in favour of the latter .  Firstly I surely agree with the opinion that students have to learn some facts . It is obviously important to know certain things but it can not be the main objective . As I experienced , the things you remember in the end are not the ones hardly learned and memorised , but the ideas and concepts transmitted by a book or a professor . To be capable to memorise you need to connect the facts and to transform them in bigger pieces , in concepts .  Secondly it is not just important to know things , but to understand them . By memorising numbers and numbers of facts you do n't automatically also understand them and you are not necessarily able to see them in relation to other factors . You are may not able to see the overall meaning of all the factors learned .  Thirdly , when actually using the the knowledge learned , you need concepts and ideas rather than pure facts . For example if you are a doctor , it does not help you to just know where the knee is but also to be aware of all the different parts of the body that can influence and affect the knee . Experiencing pain in the knee is not necessarily caused by the knee itself . It can also be originated in another part of the body .  Summarising I think there should be both , the learning of facts - serving as a basis of knowledge - and the understanding of concepts and ideas , to be able to get the meaning of the knowledge learned and memorised . What counts in the end is the ability of using the knowledge and this is just possible when having a profound understanding of the facts learned .	GER
In my opinion it is true that young people are starting to have lots of different distraction that are separating them from many interesting activities and responsabilities as helping their communities .  But it is something that have been increasing several years ago .  The development of new technologies as internet , mobiles , televitions , dvds , computer games , etc , have extended another ambitions and purposes in life .  Nowdays teenager prefer to sit in front of a dvd player or play with their mobiles instead share some evenings in some communities where all kind of activities or services are planned .  First of all , I think one of the reason is the education that they are receiving from their parents and from the schools . It seems to be more important to know how to use internet than which was the last book that they read .  Secondly in this communities the should try to attrack teenagers offering them different kind of activities which could make them interested in going to this communinties and participate . For example , organizing : concerts ( all types of music : classical , pop , rock ... ) , football games or other kind of sports , creating a library which would include : internet , books , cd 's , dvd 'd ; also try to perform some plays or go to the theatre . Also know much more about the place that they live and the enviroment in general not just the group or the city that they live .  At last , when young people can enjoy in this enviroment they will be very excited and very decided to colaborate in any kidn of activity or help that the community can create or organize .  My conclusion is that if the community present a good range of attractive and new activities any youn people will be so happy to colaborate in the well being og the community	SPA
Today , to move , the people , in general , use theirs cars . The numbers of cars increase always but in an other side , the prize of cars and oil increase too . On one hand , some people think in twenty years they will use than there are today . Indeed , having a car is more and more expensive . On the earth , there less and less oil so the prize increase a lot and all people can not pay it . Moreover , in the biggest cities , the common transports will be very developed like in Paris where the government make news bus ' route . They want that Paris will becomea citie with no cars . Indeed , some people think we need to stop use the cars because that due to the increase of polution .  One the other hand , the cars is the best to move . Indeed , with cars you can go everywhere and when you want . You do not wait like with bus and subways . Maybe the prize of oil increase , however , all government try to find a solution . For example , in France , the government want to introduce a new oil product with cereal . This oil is ever use in some countries like Brazil where a lot cars use this oil and where the oil is less expensive than in France . Moverover , this vegetal oil can stop the polution in the biggest cities . And finaly , with a car , the people do what they want like at home . They chose the radio station they want to listen , they can fume , they can phone .  According to me , the common transport can developed a lot again . But with the new technologies , all the people would like his own cars and I think in twenty years there be more cars in use than there are today .	FRE
it is not the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the given topic in itself is self explainatory . because having broad knowledge of many acdemic subjects would be not be any use unless we command any one of them it is something like jack of all trades master of none .  the broad knowledge of many subjects would only let you know the subjects but to master any subject you have to specialize in one specific subject . my point of veiw is to specialize in one subject to know many subjects because doing we will be in more depth of one then just be superficially attached to many this can be further elabaroting by taking certain e.g like a general doctor can treat many diseases but can struck in some critical disease where as specialist doctor can tke care of complex disease in his specialised branch .  same way in any other branch you take it a specialist would always have an upper on a non specialist today where the world devoloping at such a past pace the contribution of a specialist would be more than a non specialist specialist can help in higher research program vis-vis cant specialist can go in for extensive studies in his and can get fruitful results which can be used for the betterement of the human race as per the subject concern	HIN
Someone suggests that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . But I quite disagree with it .  First of all , I like to enjoy the journey in my own way . I always like the pleasure of freedom . Arranging the travel is a hard work , but it is quite intreseting . But to be led by a tour guide , I have to obey the instructions he makes . I have to follow the whole group to go to somewhere I do n't want to , I have to go to the places ordered by tour guide , eat the food ordered by tour guide , even go to toilet at the time fixed by tour guide . So we hire a tour guide or we hire a commander ? Furthermore , the tour guide always says the same thing just likes the travel book . I can see it in the hotel , or through the Internet , why I should hire a tour guide for this ?  Second , which is even worse , is that tour guide only have most profitablt routes , so there are many places I can n't find a tour guide . Especially for some very exciting undeveloped district , it 's very hard to get a tour guide . Last time , some friends and I wanted to go the a moutain in our province , after we explorered all the websites of the tour company , none of them had this route . We had to go by ourselves .  Third , someone acclaims that traval in a group led by a tour guide will save money . It make sense sometime . But business is business , you have to pay extra money for the guide not the journey itself . Moreover , some tour guide will bring tourists to shops , malls but not the places we want to . Just because this shops , malls will pay tour guide for bringing business . I even heard that some tour guide cheated and blackmailed the tourists about eating , transportation , etc . It 's quite difficult to find a good tour guide .  To sum up , I do not like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .	CHI
In this essay I 'll discuss if I agree or disagree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . First of all , I want to say that I do n't agree completely with this statement because is too semplicistic say that young people now do not give enough time to helping their communities .  In fact , for sure , there are a lot of young people nowadays who think only about theirselves and do n't spend time for helping their communities but , on the contrary , there are a lot of young people involved in social activities .  In fact , I knew a lot of young people everyday involved in some different activities to helping their communities above all young people part of specific groups . For example , they help children with family problems to do their homework after the school , they play guitar during church celebration on sunday and when I was younger and I attented the secondary school , in particular , I also did a lot of these kind of activities but unfortunately now I do n't have enough time to do these and so I try to do something else .  As a lot of young people in fact , I 'm part of the red cross and for this reason twice a year I go the hospital and I give for free my blood to help a lot of people who everyday need blood due to some different problems .  In conclusion , I can say that I agree with the fact that there are a lot of people nowaday that do not give enought time to helping their communities but I want underline instead , that there are a lot of young people very sensible , acting in social activies and for these reasons that spend a lot of thei time for helping the others .

I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .  The first reason why I agree with this statement is that young people have changed . In old days in Korea , young people were very helpful . They helped to build houses and fix things , which are dangerous and hard . This works were for young people and they did it without hesitation . However , these days young people do not care about their communities . Young people , nowadays , have different attitudes .  Another reason that I think is that young people are not connected with communities . In Korea , young people , who assume as students , are very busy studying . They go school at 7 in the morning and come back in the mid-night . They have no time to participate for their communities . Whereas , in old days in Korea , there were more people who were not student and also school works were not hard .  Last but not least , some young people wants to help their communities . For example , helping and taking care of elderly people or children . However , I am not sure about other countries , but in Korea , parents usually do not want their children , who are students , to help for their communities . The reason is obvious that they want their children to study for their future university rather than caring about their communities .  Taking into account of all factors , people are becoming more egoistic , not only young people , but also their parents and adults . Anyhow , we may reach the conclusion that the statement is correct .	KOR
I think it depends on individual 's preference . Someone like to trip in a group led by a tour , and others do not . I 'm a person of the latter type and I disagree with that statement . I do n't like to travel in a group led by a tour guide , because travel in a group led by a tour guide will deprive flexibility from the trip .  It is true that relying on a tour guide is comfortable . Someone should think that even planning where to visit is bothering . A group trip led by a tour guide is suitable for such a person . Tour guides are professional to plan and to travel safely . The trip led by a guide should be easy and safe . Traveling in a group led by a tour guide , however , lacks flexibility in the plan .  In some cities , there are too many famous places , and travelers are forced to choose some from them . In London or New York , for instance , we have to spent three or four days in a museum if we try to see every thing exhibited there . In such a case , travelers should obey the plans of the tour if they participate in a tour led by a tour guide . A people who are especially interested in arts and wants to stay longer at a museum should prefer traveling freely .  Sometimes I change my plan during a trip . When I visited Germanany when I was an undergraduate student , I planned to visit five cities during the one week trip . At the first place I visit , however , I was so impressed by the beautiful scene of a river and castle that I changed my plan and stayed there for one week . Consequently , I visited only one city during the trip .  When we travel , we often encounter impressive scenary or event at the place we visit during the trip . Traveling in a group led by a tour guide do not allow us to change the plan stay there for longer time than we planned before .	JPN
The topic whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well is a controversial topic . I would agree with the statement .  The main reason to support the statement is that trying new things and taking risks somtines gives innovative ideas and better insights to solve a problem at hand . For example Einstien , a famous scientist , continuously tried new things and figured out innovative methods to reach a conclusion . As a result he has given the world new theories and explanations which the world was unaware of . Einstien is one of the world 's greatest scientists ever known .  Secondly , doing what we already know how to do well is just blindly ignoring the changing factors surrounding us . For example , my father knew how to make a spear very well . I learnt the art of spear making from my father . But with all the tecnological advancements and innovative methos around i can not say that the method known to me is the best method . Today spears can be preapared with machines which are faster and more accurate . So in order to do things well we need to have a clear understanding of the changing enviornment conditions .  Third , If people donot try new things and donot take more risks then the world economy would not grow and come to a halt . For example , Bill gates , the founder of microsoft , took a risk of venturing into the computer industry when critics predicted that he would fail miserably . He continued to work hard and was able to succeed in the end . Microsoft generated huge employments and created products which helped ease certain tasks significantly . Microsoft helped the world economy to grow at a faster pace by introducing technological advancements and generating employment . Bill gates today is one of the richest persons in the world . Had he not taken the risk of starting a new company he would not have been successful .  In conclusion people who try new things taking calculated risks succeed . People who only do what they already know may become successful but not to the same extent achieved by people who take risks .	HIN
I agree with the statement . There are three main reasons for that . First , ideas and concepts are more various than facts . Facts have the tendensy , but all ideas and concept is defferent from each other by people who made them . Second , to learn is easy , but to understand is difficult . Students should study hard and not get easy . Finally , if students understand ideas and concepts , they apply thier knowledge to thier life in the future . Only to learn facts is not useful . Therefore , I think that students should make the much effort to understnd ideas and concept , not to learn facts .	JPN
Intd : new things create success reach goals leads invention i agree with the statement successful people try new things . Because if they try the new things then only they will success in life oterwise their life is stationary . For ex : Bill gates is moel for everyone in computer world . He succeeded by reaching goals because he tried so many things differently . In my openion trying new things is the mother of invention . So many scientists trying differently and facing so many problems creates wonderful life for us . For ex thomas edison invented florescent light bulb change our lives alot . after that several changes occur due to trying of new things If we want success and growth in our life or in job definitely we need to try new things and then only we will overcross other competetors and succeed in life .  so i storngly agree with the statement all people succeed by trying new things in	TEL
I agree with this statement . Advertising is an art , an art of making products seem attrative and perfect . It is also the art of convincing the consumers to buy the product . Consumers who are not wise enough or who are too influencable buy products because of the advertisements .  First of all I would say adverstiment companies tend to have a lot of money so they can make beautiful , attrative advertisements . They have a lot of means to attract to consumer . TV advertsiments are the easiest way to convince a consumer to buy your product whereas written advertisments in newspapers for example are less convincing because they are not interactive . On TV ads you can see people use , eat the product the company is selling . They reach more easily the consumer .  Second of all , advertisments are made to make products seem better than they are in real life . It is an art . For example when you see an advertisment for a frozen pizza , the pizza always looks hot , savourous . Usually you can see the cheese melt whereas when you buy it and you heat it up it is nothing compared to that advertisment , it is a normal frozen pizza not a home made one .  Third of all advertisement is a lure for consumers . People do not buy a product for its consistency but for the way it looks in the ad . Sometimes ads tend to lie about the the qualities of the product for example toothpaste that make your teeth white as the snow , or a soap which eliminates all the imperfections of a teenage skin .  To conclude I would say advertisement make products seem much better than they really are because it is one of the goal of advertsiment the first one being to sell a product . But to sell a product in huge quantities you have to make it special , better than the others , attractive or even emphazise the results of this product .	FRE
In my opinion , this is a very strong statement and I can not totally agree with it in the way in which it is currently phrased . As a first general point , I think that similar statements can never hold absolutely true or false , so before discussing the merit of my opinion , I would like to narrow down the reach of the statement by specifying a particular geographical or cultural setting that we are referring to when talking about young people and their communities . I will therefore take my home country as a reference .  Communities face constant changes as society as a whole change , and most of these changes result into challenges and demands imposed over individuals of all ages . In particular , the beginning of the 21st century has seen a macroconomy revolution in terms of the labour market - in particular highly specialised and trained labour - and information technology resources . Extensive outsourcing of certain services to Asian countries and moving big parts of the manufacturing industries to the Far East caused many young people to be unemployed in Europe , and in my home country too , as a result . Where once communities used to be wealthy and secure employment could guarantee social welfare and enough free time for everyone to spend with their families or in social activities , now the younger generations face difficulties in earning enough to mantain thei usual standards of living . I agree that they spend less time helping out their communities , and Therefore , it is understandable that they will have to dedicate a lot of time to job hunting or even engage into a second and a third occupation , and will have no time or energy to spend on helping the community they live in . Well organised activities such as participation into charities work , or more spontaneous and ` private ' ones such as caring for an elderly member of the family or a disabled neighbour will eventually have to be put aside by those young who face economic difficulties , and will only be pursued by the luckiest individuals who do not have to worry about earning enough to feed themselves and their children .

The issue at hand is that it is better to have broad knowedge many academic subgects than to specialize in one specific subgect . I agee this because people live various world and change quikly .  The first reason that I agree that to have broad knoweage is that it can be prvent for isolation from the peaple . I was a nurse in my contry and need more various knowedge such as english , socialogy , abd culture . To in order to socialate other peole , I need to many academic knowedge . I think that it is important to have various information as well as nusing  The second reason I believe that I prefer person who have broad knowlede of many academic subgect is that we live various world . If I know one thing , I do n't understant fileds of others . it causepeople have prejudice the other one .  In conclusion , I content that our society there is changed so qulicky . We have to learn various thing .	KOR
Traffic issues are certainly a huge problem in our current world . A distance of ten kilometers would usually take about ten minutes to cross twenty years ago ; however , nowadays that same distance would take about fourty minutes to cross . People are beginning to wonder if a person walked a certain distance , or drove in a car , does the walking individual reach the designated point faster ? Such issues are becoming a serious concern to our world . Yet every problem must have a solution , and earth has a trait that when a human creates a problem , eventually he will find a solution . Yet that solution , would cause another problem .  I personally agree with the statement since already certain protocols are being done in order to deal with such a problem . Mass transit has be extremely subsidized and an incentive to carpool is being stressed upon . Subway rails , trains , and monorails are being created inorder to draw away all the individuals found on the roads . In twenty years their will be definatly fewer cars than what is present today , since individuals would no longer depend on a biast form of transport . Certain cities in our world today can prove how mass transit is an effective way of reducing the number of cars .  London , England is a perfect example to be used as a city who uses all its transportation methods and incentives to the max . A person who lives in London does not necesarilly need to be stuck in rush hour when he is tired from work and just wants to go home . Such an individual can just enter the tube station and ride the subway to the nearest station to his residence . This type of transportation when people began to adapt to it greatly affected the roads of London , as year by year the streets began to clear up . Countries would probably follow the footsteps of London in the near future .  Tokyo , Japan is another example of a country that enforces mass transit ; however poorly exectued . Underground stations are present within the city , yet the transit system does not support such a mass amount of individuals . Such a situation might solve the problem of fewer cars on the road , but it causes the problem of more people crowded at underground stations .  The examples presented support the theory behind this argument , which is yes their will be fewer cars in twenty years than their is today ; however , that does not solve the main problem . Cars on their own do not cause a crowding effect , people driving the cars cause the crowding effect . When mass transits are used efficiently , than that certain amount of individuals will be evenly distributed among different routes of transport . Yet if mass transit is provoked , than that mass of individuals would just yield to another route , transfering the same problem from point A to point B. Fewer cars will be present in twenty years , but its up to each individual country to distribute the main problem .	ARA
Advertisements are a source to reach out to the people and to pass on a message that one wants to say . People are influenced in a wide range on watching these advertisements . Many products are marketed through this procedure .  Most of the products are not as worthed as they are shown in the advertisements . Marketing personals do not actually show the reality but try to convince the public that their product contains good quality and quantity : but they dont .  For instance , the advertisement of a beauty cream or a face pack is marketed with an attractive presentation but that product actually doesnt show much effect on anyone and the side effects will not be mentioned in that advertisement . Similarly , the products of food and snacks also do not show any growth regarding health but are shown in such a way that they can produce lots of energy and strength in a person . Offcourse , one cant find the clothes shining so brightly forever , with a detergent or wash powder as it is shown in the advertisements . Its all about attracting people in a false manner towards their product . It would be fare enough if the real quality of the products are shown in the advertisements . Only few products do effect on the people as the way they are displayed .  In conclusion , I do agree that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	TEL
In my opinion is better to have a knowledge specialize in one specific subject because this is better to know a thing as well as you can . This is true in all the experiences of the life : refered to the university ( the italian university ) we can take the example of the of the two years of specialization .  An other example we can find in a great company , infact each people that there are in this have a specific work to do and this bring to an excellent final operation .  A person that are magnifically prepare on one thing will arrive at a sicure result because that `` is your bred '' ; we can also observe that the most good professors , scientists , nobels , athlets are all specialize on that they work and do not specialize on many works .  We can also saw that the colloboration of great brains , each of them specialized on a thing , is important in many ways of the our life .	ITA
I certainly agree with the following statement , which says that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .  We all know that advertising have a high impact on people it 's the only way to promote a product , so in order to convince them to buy their should be a kind of exageration somewhere but bear in mind that we should n't be unrealistic .  We have different types of exageration in order to make a product seem better and all depends on the type of media , for example when talking about the billboards , how many times we saw an ad or an offer for a fast food restaurant , they shows a big burger and says that we can now buy one and get the other one for free , wow amazed by this offer we all go to this restaurant and order the offer , but surprisingly we see that the burger is such a miniature and if we eat 1o of them we wont be satisfy ! so in this case they played with the font of the ad .  Another example will be a whitening cream , they tells us that in 4 weeks we 'll have a white princess skin , the first step for those who wants to whiten their skin is to go and buy this product , they use it for 1 month maybe but no differences at all so we all wonder here if the problem comes from us or the produst itself !  Too many examples can support my answer well let 's list another one , the best example ever is the `` best seller '' which is an advertising program seen on tv , well here comes a catastrophe because they shows too many product and try them on the tv , but when we order them home i bet we can use them more than 1 week because they 're bad quality .  Detergents are one of the products that do not show the real effect of it , for example when they show us a certain laundry detergent on the tv , they bring a t-shirt and drop coffee , chocolat , ketchup . .. on it and as a magic all is gone and the latter becomes white as if we just bought it .  Also advertising for clothes , home aplliances , cars , technology etc ! has an impact and a strong one over customers beacause some people even if they do n't like the product or do n't use it they will buy it maybe because their celebrity is in it .  I think that good companies do not promote their products , we can see very profitable companies with a relative high profit which do n't put an ad on the tv but everyone goes and buy from it , that 's because it 's an old and trusty one , also now we can differ from a medecine which is good or bad , every company which promote a medecine is certainly facing a low return and it 's medecine is not that good because in general we put ads in order to attract customers and who is not in need wont do it .  Advertising is an important thing but should some limitations in order to be more realistic and so can attract many people , it 's better to be real than a dream one ! .	ARA
Travelling tops the list of many people 's choice to spend their leisure time for . But whether to follow a group led by a tour guide remains a controversial question for the travellers at their planning stage of the tour . In my opinion , the best way to travel has little to do with following a large group .  People tend to rely on a group and stick to it for security or consensus or whatever they needed , but when it comes to travelling , things might fall on the opposite side . The assertion of unity means the denial of freedom , it is especially ture when , with the guide of a tour guide , one can not indulge himself in the freedom of choosing what travelling sites to visit or what time to start and there is a greater chance that the true meaning of travelling , relaxation being my defenition , might be raped by arguments and complaints .  Some people would contridict my point by saying that a tour guide offers valuable and well-informed suggestions that would make a better trip . But is n't there enough news of tourists being cheated or made use of for the sake of tour guides ' benefits ? By saying this , I am not saying that tourist are more skilled at escaping tricks when travelling by themselves , nor am I judging the moral standard of all tour guides , it 's just that is n't it even sadder to be fooled when certain investment and trust and already been placed on the tour guide ?  In addition , travelling fullfills different purposes for different people . Some want to escape the hustles and bustles of the city , some wish to explore the unknown world , some aspire to adventure through exciting places , and none of these seem attainable by following the lead of a tour guide whose job is to keep everyone in sight and control .  Good or bad , there is no absolute truth , however , we always have the right to chase what we want when travelling .	CHI
According to my opinion , the statement that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know is the one open for debate . Curosity has become a driving force which led to the new inventions and discoveries from century . Man from the time when he hunted the food than today when all the latest technologies are available . In this essay , i will first analyse ideology of succesful person and whether optimism and audacity is the only criteria for becoming succesful and base my suggestion in favour of being optimistic .  If we turn the pages of the history , one thing we find common in all the greatest leaders is the quality of being optimistic . They do not hesitate to take any audacious decision and exploring new things . Take for example , George Washington , americas first president , he always showed enthusiasm in trying out new thing . The other example is Abrahim Lincoln , a person who had reached the great height in his carrear by taking risks and experimenting with new things .  I also support the point that , if we do those things we already know we can do those tasks more accurately and with less effort . However , this does not increse our effecincy . Think of the primitive world , where our ancestors were very good in hunting and if they have never tried out of breaking the old rituals of hunting and started living like civilised people we could have not reached the apex on which we are today .  Obstacles are are the milestones which show us the path of success . While overcoming obstacles and taking new kind of risks people become stronger and discover new limits of success .  I would like to conclude by stating that , if u want to reach the apex of success than make yourself accustomed with different kind of risk and obstecle and In all conscience u will become succesful	HIN
I agree wich this idea : most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . There are two important reasons why I think that this statement is true .  First , today , in our society , the most important thing for people has become the appearance , and not the really essence of things . In the every day life of each individual , the esthethical and exterior aspects , such as clothes , beautifulness , money , richness and material things are most relevant rather than the interior aspects , such as ethical values , love , friendliness , helpfulness etc . . For this reason people think tha is right to appear and to demonstrate these aspects rather than their essece .  Second , today tv , radio , papers and others forms and source of informations , like mass meedia have devoloped very quickly connecting groups of different people all over the world . So individuals are slaves of this information sphere that influence them .  So we can transport this two concepts from the life of people to their relationship with the different kinds of products , which they see and consider all day . I think that because people are are influenced and pay great attention to exterior aspects most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  In conclusion , I think that this process is really developed , but it is wrong and it demage our society within few years .	ITA
I agree with the atatement that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years . There will be three points to support my idea . Then , I will list these three points as follows :  First of all , the governments of today put more investment to improve the public traffic mass , and there will be less need to purchase a private car . Most of the people in our city buy cars because there are so few public bus and subways , and It always make them be late to work or school . So if the government gives its buget more to build the public traffic system , fewer citizens will buy cars . And since the Traffic mass Action began progress in our city , the number of the cars has already declined .  Another thing that will due to the reduction of the car 's number is that the less amount and the large expense of the crude oil resources . Nowadays , fewer oil field can be entract enough crude oils for people to use . In order to explore new oil resources , we put our eye to the sea floor . You know , to drill an oil well on the sea floor need much more expences and more modern techniques . In addition to the war began in the Middle East , the expense of the oil raised far more repaid than we could expected . If we want to run a car , we should spend more money on the expense of fuel then ever before . And I think this situation will not be change in the next twenty years . As a result , it will make us reduce to use car than nowadays .  Last but not the least is that the people 's conception to protect the environment and reduce the pollution . By using car , it will cause a lot of environment problems such as air pollution , noise pollution . All these will be harm to human 's body . However , people now concerntrate more on the health problem than ever before . So they will reduce the use of cars to decline the pollution it caused . For this reason , the number of cars will of course be delined in next 20 years .  All in all , the governments ' action , the limited natural resources , and the mind of people to decline the pollution all put functions in the reducted number of cars . And I also think fewer cars will make our life better and will also do good to the whole society .	CHI
I always think to myself , what will my grand parents do when I am having fun or boredom in school . Everytime I go pass by old people , they sit on a bench holding the leesh of their dog and watch people walk pass by . But their truth of enjoyment was something else , something more impressive and tearful . Therefore , I believe that they may not be enjoying their life in my sight , but they are certainly enjoying more than us , younger kids .  When I was at my grand parents ' place , I was investigating what they would do for the 24 hours . Their bed time was worth half of my bed time and their TV time was worth not even the half of my TV time . And even , when I was trying to entertain them by teaching them how to use the computer , they sleighed the mouse on to the computer screen which made me give up on them . Then , I realized that their enjoyment was something else , which young people can not possibily feel . When it was my bed time , my grand mother was staying up watching a series of drama . I interrupted her asking what is her entertainment in life and she answered me that her enjoyment of life is all about watching me and my mother 's day go past by safely and our fulfiment of laughter is instantly her pleasant laughter . And the next thing she said to me is that she is enjoying so much of her life that she would not regret for living , even if she dies the next day .  In conclusion , I do not know how their own enjoyment of life work , but all the tearful sayings that my grand mother had made for me touched my heart and therefore , I believe that older people enjoy their life more than us , younger kids who only knows how to play computer games .

In these days , many technology systems are developed . For example , we could play in many ways in these days like playing an X-box in their houses and go to movie theator . On the other side , the old people might not had a chance to play or watch the movie at the theator with their friends . Not only playing to get enjoy life , we could also find for our new jobs easily and find their habits easily through the internet explorer .  First of all , many young people in these days play X-box in their house . Probably in the old day , they just play outside of the sports like basketball or soccer . Howevere , in these days , we could play soccer or basketball in our house with using X-box . The new technology systems affect us in many ways . For example , we allow to talk to someone in anywhere and any time we want . By calling or e-mailing with each other , we could find the enjoyable life .  In addition , many young people in these days also go to movie theator to watch the movies . In the movie theator , we could choose the movie we want to watch . For instance , scary movie and sad movie . By watching them we could have fun time in our spare time . Also while we watch the movie we could also eat any foods we want . In the old days , they did n't have any movies , so probably they all watched the news all the time .  Finally , we could find our habits and new jobs easily by searching in the internet explorer . For example , we are interested in skiing in the winter brake , then we could search the place where we could go for the best and even we could learn how to do the ski . By searching and finding our from the internet explorer , we could find out out habit is . For instance , when I started to chat with my neighbor and I enjoy it , then it could become my habit .  In conclusion , many technology systems affect to live enjoyable life than older people did before their life . Therefore , in my opinion , I agree that the young people enjoy life more than older people did before .	KOR
Personally , I do not think that fewer cars will be used in twenty years than today .  Probably , the author of the statement bases his view on the fact that the increase of the used number of cars has been decreasing for the last 25 years . Furthermore , another thesis supporting his view might be that public transport will become not only more accessible but also less expensive . The invention of a new form of transportation might as well contribute to a reducing number of cars . Another very important point is , that the streets are overwhelmed by the number of cars and simply can not provide space to even more vehicles .  The last point seems to be pretty evident , especially in a country like Germany . However , in countries like China or in other third-world countries , space is not a restricting factor . In opposite , the development of those countries will even increase the demand for high-priced technologies as is the car . Development happens rapidly and the chance that countries like India or South Africa join the club of the developed countries within the next twenty years is more than realistic .  Also the invention of a new form of transportation might not be absolutely out of space but it is nowhere in sight and it would take much longer to gain general acceptance than the given 20 years to have any impact on the number of cars in use .  What I definitely hope and as well believe is the fall of prices for public transport and its spread over the world - even in countries where it is not established yet . However , I am afraid that the car as much more comfortable choice will always attract humans enough to convince people to take it . I myself used the car for my way to this TOEFL center instead of taking bus or train . Germany again serves as a good example . While the public transport system surely is one of the best in the world , streets are filled with cars . This demonstrates that even the existence of a public transport system does not have great effects on the number of cars used . Furthermore , outside Europe , countries are much more rural than here . The establishment of a public transport system is by far more expensive than the building of roads .  The statement that the increase in the number of cars decreases is definitly true but this does not necessarily mean the end of an increasing number of cars is close . As stated before , though Europe reached a peak which can hardly be increased , in other countries the demand will rise during the following years and outnumber potential decreases in Europe .  This effect is even promoted by a rising population on the world . Though in Germany and in other highly developed countries , the number of inhabitants decreases slightly , the total number of people still increases fastly . This will not change during the following 20 summers .  Conclusively , I can not see any convenient reason why the number of cars might decrease during the next two decades - maybe an atomic war or a meteor - but nothing realistic to happen . Though I do not appreciate the trend of more cars , I am absolutely sure that it will hold on .	GER
In my view it is always helpful to have lot of interest in acquiring as much information in every field or subject rather than to concentrate merely on one subject . As far as I am concerned individual will shine if he continues to gain knowledge through out his entire life , more so in different fields as world is changing faster .  As a child I was doing lot better in most of the subjects during my Secondary school . But I never was domonating in any one subject . This continued when I was in Intermediate , which used to worry me a bit , as after the Higher Education there was an entrance exam for which I had to score very good in academic subjects . But my maternal uncle who was close to me suggested to make a slight alteration to my study pattern and concentrate on subjects which will be tested for the exam , but said to remember one important thing that jack of all trades is better than master of none .  While I was studying 10th standard I had a friend who was good in Natural science . But he never used to concentrate on other subjects as he found them uninteresting and worthless . Because of his attitude he got lot lower marks in the final and could not qualify for the State government Higher education College . He had to settle with a private college .  The main important reason for his descendancy is by gaining lots of knowledge in one particular field , he might have thought that he has nothing to learn further and stop learning all of a sudden , which is a dangerous pattern for any individual . Also he might have got bored and stopped concentrating on other topics as a whole .  The above examples in my life convinced me that by gaining knowledge of many issues and topics will help you interact more expressively with your colleagues and make you more socially interactable .  Also with changing world all the time every second , by keeping this attitude in your mind , will help you adapt quickly and smoothly .	TEL
In my point of view , I am diagree with the statement , and these are my reasons .  First of all , because of different ages , people enjoy their life in different ways , but it does n't mean older people donnot enjoy life . For example , Compare with younger couples , instead of drunk and dance like mad . older couples are like to go to travel together and to recall their honeymoons . Even thoungh it looks pretty boring for younger people , but those moments are significant in the older people 's life . So older people actually know how to enjoy their time more healthy and more meaningfully .  Second , there are lot of things that older people can also enjoy , such as younger 's favor things -- parties , clubs , and gem . Older people like to go to somewhere that more quiet than the party rooms but they do enjoy dance with their lovers and share their special beauties to the one who is important for them . And also they love to go to club to know more people and friends . For example , my grandmother luses to go to parties and have fun with her friends .  Third , here is one thing that younger people can not undertand and enjoy but older people loved -- garden works . younger people assum that garden works are only for grandparents for their extra times . But actually it is not true , garden works is another way that show how much the older people enjoy lifes , because of time goes by very fast , so the older people enjoy the moment that when their flowers grew up , or their apple tree has little apples and so on . Because they undertand the joy to creative life and in order to enjoy life .  Therefore , in my opinion . older people know how to enjoy their life and even better than younger people . They wo n't do anything damage for their heath , they wo n't do any childish things that bad for the communities . They have their living styles that provide for better living standards and qualities . So these are the reasons why I am disagree about the statement .	CHI
I think success can be achieved in different ways , not only by taking risks and chances . In the coming paragraphs , different points will be stated and discussed in order to properly analyze the statement given .  First of all , success can be a relative term , because for some it may mean owning a private jet and having millions of dollars , but for others success could simply be having a good , small business that maintains their family and gives them a decent life . Not everybody wants the same things , some just want to live a quiet , normal life and nothing more . Taking a risk is a possibility , but never a sure thing .  Also , it 's difficult to achieve succes in life , since it requires many abilities from a person . There are many key ingredients involved in the process of MAYBE achieving success . It takes hard work , dedication , being fully prepared and intelligence . Usually people do n't acheive success by accident . It takes years and years , and sometimes that is not enough . Just because a person has all those ingredients does n't guarantee them a bright future full of riches . Most people have worked hard all their life but have n't gotten anywhere they want to go .  Another important point is the fact that succes can be achieved by doing what a person already knows how to do well . Sometimes it 's as simple as that . To work hard at you 're craft and make smart moves can equally take you towards success . For example , if a person studies economics and ends up working at the NYCSE , he can achieve a fortune by just putting to work all those years of studying he did in college or university . By just applying his knowledge to the stock market and making smart choices , he can become rich , but he can also lose it all . It 's not so much about risk but about making smart choices .  In conclusion , I would like to be clear that while many people have taken risks and tried new things in order to achieve succes , where some have won many more have failed . Success is never a sure thing , and even if a person achieves it , the possibility still exists that it wo n't last for long . Once you get to the top , the only other way to go is down , sicne it 's not only difficult to reach the top but to be able to stay there . So in the end I do n't agree with the statement given . Nothing in life is certain , only death and taxes .	SPA
I agree with this statement , but I would also say that nowadays are even a lot of young people , who helps in their communities , but most of them are not be registers .  I think , the reason why some many young people do not spend enough time or even no time helping their communities is that our whole society has growen during the last century . The results of this development is that our society is anonyme and there are no real communities .  During the last thirty years , I think , most of the communities growed into large cities , because of the processe of globalization , which is a mant factore , why communities broke and even break .  In this case it is not really suprising that many young people do not spend enough time to help their communities . Another reason , why I think this development is not suprinsing , is that the most cities and communities do not offers the young peoples the oppertunity to help . For example in germany , where I live , the government decided to close more than the half of institutions where young people can get into and help the community , maybe to plan a party for the whole community or even a special event on eastern .  This aspect is also the reason why I say that the most do not recognizes that a lot of young people support the community , because they do it in private organisations or only for their own .  So my conclusion is that it is not only the fault of the young perosns that they do not help so much , because they can not change the developments of last years and of the processe of globalization and also they can not influences the decisions of the government , because most of them are not allow to vote , because of their ages .  However , I think that young perosns are responsible for the communtiy and so I think they should support them in anyway . I also try to support my communtiy . I live in a village with a large and beautiful landscape . The problem is that this area is shaped into two statepart and so no state thinks that it is responsible for saving this area . So , the young members of the riding club , included my own , clean it twice a year . However the state governments do not realises that .	GER
The car , actually , are one of most important issue in my country . One part of the population think that reduction is impossible . Nevertheless , it will be necessary to reduce the traffic because of the pollution , traffic accidents and the rise of the gas . However it will be realistic if only public transport is improved .  Pollution is a enormous probleme on earth . We know exactly that cars have got a big responsibility .  Car accidents cause plenty of deaths and hurts . Alcohol and speed are principally involved .  The price of the gas has been edging up for a long time . It certainely will continu .  However , the regulation will be effective only if public transport is improved . We have to provide to the population an effective subway , railroad , reliable and not too expensive .  This represent a challenge . But in regard of the pollution , accident and the price , this will be very attractive only if public transport is improved .	FRE
I agree successful people will try new things and take the risk . First of all , When we were young , we try lots of new things because we have to , but sometime , we take risk to be successed . I believe successful people are different than normal people , They will not scared the risks so they try the new thing . Therefore , we always enjoy new high technolgy product because they try .  Secondly , if people just do they same thing over and over , they willnot know what the good at and they will never improve themselve , they should try new things when they were young , to tell yourself you can be do what another people did , even better than them . For example , you are vice president in company , because you did a good job in the company , but the president get fired , you want to keep your position or get the highest position if you take the risks which is get fire from the boss . You never know if you do n't try .  Thridly , since we already did well in something , why you do n't chanllage high level to widen your eyes . If you know the mistakes you have made , you just do n't take the mistake again , and then next time you will do better . so on you will be successed in your job . For example , you work in one store for a long time , you already tried lots of things , learn a lots in the store , you knew how to run a company and do well , and now you want to open your own store , you just need to take risks and make yourself successed .  In couclusion , it 's because lots of people try new things and they were successful , so that oue live standand is getting mych more higher , we ca n't stop all the time , otherwise , our live never improve .

Travel is an activity that could be traced as far as the beginnings of humanity . Thanks to travel remote lands were populated , empires were built and civilizations were conquered . Over the centuries , travel has had a social connotation : an activity that it is usually done in group . However , that does not mean that it is a uniquely social activity . Many individuals often travel by themselves and enjoy individual travel .  Travel is either a leassure or a business activity . For the purpose of this essay , and due to the nature of the question , leassure travel will be addressed . Tourism is a multibillion dollar business that responds to a wide range of market demands . Over the years , it has become more and more refined . A person , or a family can find from vacation packages to the Caribbean to tours to the space .  Travel in groups led by a tour guide are often well organized trips : the number of people is set , the destinations are well assesed , the timing for each activity is carefully structured and the tour guide is usually a tourist professional . People bond together when travelling in a group . In addition , and because of economies of scale , another potential benefit of group travel are the lower and more affordable costs for the tourist . Group travel is often cheaper than individual travel .  However , group travels lead by a tour guide may also have disadvatages . People in tour groups are tied to the destinations , schedules and timing of the tour . If someone wants to visit a different place or stay longer in a stop , it is likely that such options are not available . Also , they are often tied to the meals and hotels offered by the tour . So , if a person does not like any of these , it would be very hard - or more costly - to change it . In summary , people who travel in groups lead by a tour guide are more restricted than when travelling by themselves .  There is no right or wrong answer for advocating or rejecting group travel led by a tour guide . It depends on the individual or family 's preferences , as well as on the available budget , and ultimately the degree of privacy and restrictions that a person is comfortable with when travelling .

I agree with the fact that it is important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts . Ideas and concepts are two essential factors for learning . Ideas are the way by which one would learn about something by his past knowledge , by his past experience or by your imagination . Concepts are the one that provide you the with the fundamentals of learning things .  Take an example of car and an aircraft . Both are different objects for tranportation . The idea behind developing them was to develop different means of tranportation fulfilling the different needs of human . The basic concepts involved in developing them are the different laws of motion , pure sciences . The fact is that a car is used for transport on land whereas an aircraft is used as means of tranport in air . It is important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts first . The facts can be learnt once you are proficient with the ideas and concepts . If they only know the facts and not the concept , their learning would be limited . If they continue to learn things this way ( by knowing facts ) , they would not be able to apply knowledge of their learning . Emphasing further , it would be important for the students to learn the ideas and concepts first which when combined would give rise to facts . Thus a student if learnt the basic idea and concept of laws of motion could automatically understand the facts involved with that .  Ideas and concepts , facts are different ways of learning things . But ideas and concepts are the foundation pillars of your knowledge . Your building ( knowledge ) strength lies in your foundation and not on our asthetic view ( in this case the facts learning ) which just gives a shallow knowledge about the strength of your building founadtion .

The lack of social commitment among youngs has been a common perception since always . It is very common to listen on media or simply when old people are chatting , that yougsters don-t participate or that they are not interested on the community problems . However , I disagree completely with this opinion , not only because I think that it is only a prejudice , but also because from my own experience I can state the oposite .  On one hand , the base in with the opinion that yougnsters don-t give enough time to helping their communities lays is the comparison with the behaviours of older people nowadays and in the past , when they were young . In the first case , it seems to me that there is no data to support any different behaviour between the different generations . In my opinion , what creates this perception is the recall or past days , which never is accurate . In the second case , I think that the great demonstrations that happened during the 60s and 70s related with the wars that took place and the stress between the Eastern and Western blocks helps in a large extent to magnificy the false impression that youngsters used to be more commited .  On the other hand , I can say from my own experience that young people dedicate time to helping their communities . I collaborate as a volunteer in a local ONG and there , the great majority of the volunteers are as young as me or even younger . But young people are also commited with their communities in many other ways that perhaps are no so visible as struggles in demonstrations . I have friends who form part of political parties and who are very active in any action that is carried out into the community .  In conclusion , young people is as commited with their communities as they used to be . The reason why it is believed that their commitment has changed is that the ways of participating helping the community are less visible , as can be an ONG .	SPA
Well , i opine in consense with the statement given . Yes , i actually prefer to be assisted by a tour guide when i am travelling as a group . The reasons that support my argument are disclosed as under ! .  Firstly it would be of great advantage to be accompanied by a guide because it proves to be beneficial to be directed in a place which a group is not well acquainted with . It is better to be guided in a place which is new to us because it prevents the group of tourists being split up in case of any misshappening ! . Therefore the group is led in a unison preventing the chaos of losing some members . Hence it saves a lot of time to concentrate on the purpose oftravel . Secondly employing a guide provides us the detail of all the important places to be visited . Therefore it provides us with a good review of all the important places without missing any . This again saves us time in searching out for places to be visited ! .  Third pont of advantage of employing a guide is that of the awareness of the places visited . A guide really provides us with very valuable information as of how , why , when and other related questions of the places visited . Therefore it is of great advantage as the knowledge regarding the places is complete .  Another advantage is that of the communication with the people of that habitat ! . This is really very important because the right way of communication with the local people might be really very difficult in most of the cases . This might mislead a group in knowing certain things for example the whereabouts or a route to a monument for that matter . Therefore if a guide is accompanying us we need not really face the communication problems as he translates the dialect of the local people and speaks out that is really understood by us .  Another important advantage is that a guide might really help us to sort out our accomodation at an economical place in case we are paying more for the stay than we are actually meant to pay . This again proves us an economic advantage of employing a guide ! .  Therefore from the reasons which i have disclosed i really favour employing a guide although it is a bit expensive .	TEL
After World War II , one of the bloody battles of history , a more pacifist communities appeared by the important and helpful assistance of international organizations . Since then , societies were naturally wanted to live in peace without any conflicts therein . Moreover , this perception was supported by economics and particularly 1980s was a significant corner for young people who were educated by their parents closely lived the damages of wars around the world . Hence young people started to feel themselves isolated from the society and their major purpose was the ocuupation and money making as much as they can . Nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . I complety agree with this statement because of several reasons . Young people want to enjoy their time before computer screen and video games and they wish to realize their career goals without paying attention to society .  No matter how the percentage is , it is obvious that young people love video games . An increasing number of video games are experienced and young people avoid from being with their family members , friends and even the members of community . Yet community handles various problems which are to be resolved without losing time . For instance , unemployment is a major event for today 's societies . Young people appreciate playing video games instead of searching for solutions to unemployment . Since young people are more energic and active , they can be involved in projects looking for solutions to unemployment .  Besides , young people are much focused on money making istead of fundemental social problems of community . It is doubtless that career golas are important for young people but major community problems would eventually effect the large numbers of individuals soon . In the last decade of 20th centuty , foundations played a great role in society because of their supportive function and weel organized structure as weel . Be that as it may , regard is to be had on the fact that a widely participation of young people led to this success at that time .  In a nutshell , I strongly believe that young people nowadays do not give enoung time to helping their communities . Probably it originates from misleading of youngers both in school or family but whatever the reason is governments should definetely bring a detailed insight to this situation and product solutions otherwise whole of the society will encounter different problems . This is because younger people are those on whom the society is being built .	TUR
Do I agree ? Well , I do not agree . I was young once and I 'm getting old now , so that makes me somewhat an expert in the matter . First of all there are many reasons that would not support that theory , such as : Inexperience , Carelesness , Finaces and the fact that youngsters think that they know it all . Lets elaborate on the first one ; it summarizes in one phrase , `` A person can only gain experience one day at the time . '' Finances , are a big deal big deal in your younger years , you are living on a tight budget and most of the time you can not adhere to it , because all the media , peer pressure and nevertheless inmaturity . Finaces can very easy make your younger years hard and like we all know that generates an snowball effect on everything else .  Moving on , carelesness and `` know-it-all syndrome '' , what can I say , in a way they all derive from eachother . These theories are backed up by facts and figures that wont lie , I live through them . These are the reasons why I do not agree with that statement ; older people are wiser , more thougthful , financialy secure and of course more careful about doing again the stupid things they did in their earlier years . Also when you are older there is a great chance that you are finacially secure , and can afford the nicer things in life .  In conclusion , as we all know , life is a race . .. so by far older people the winners in this race .	SPA
Taking risks and trying new things have in common one thing : they are scary or , at least , they are not as comfortable as doing always the same things . Yet , I am conviced that they are necessary in order to be successful .  Risking can be frightening - I will not deny it . However , if you do not risk , you miss important opportunities to improve your condition . Every decision in life , from everyday to once-in-a-lifetime ones , implies some risk . If you are not able to take risks , this means that you are not able to take challenging decisions , with the obvious results .  Furthermore , in certain situations , taking a risk can make the difference between someone who just accepts what he or she has ( but might regret what he or she has not ) and someone who is really satisfied . Just think of a recently graduated student who receives a very interesting offer which requires moving to another country : should he stay home and try to find an average job or accept it ? I am convinced he should accept it and leave straight away , otherwise he might simply regret it for the rest of his life .  On a less personal level , there are contests where trying new things is almost mandatory . This is the case for example of researchers : questioning the status quo , trying out different possible solutions is necessary in order to find out new things - and where would the world be wihtout new inventions ? I can not imagine a researcher who does not want to try new things .  For all these reasons , I am conviced that successful people are those who are not afraid of risking . People who just keep doing what they are good at just miss out opportunity - because that is what a change really is .	ITA
Some people say that students have to learn facts rather than to understand ideas and concepts . They insists that learning facts get a chance to be more develop technology . However , I agree that it is important for students to understand concepts . First , understanding concepts can entail facts . Second , when students enter the university , they can be applicable other fields . I will explain in detail .  More than anything else , understanding ideas can get a chance to obtain facts more . Ususally , lots of people think that relations between understanding concepts and learning facts are separated with each other . However , coherent understanding idea can result in learning facts . Let me take a friend of mine for example . When he was in university , he made an effort to study exclusive idea . From exclusive idea , he could make a conclusion such as math formular . He always told me that it was easy to people for memorizing facts , however , the facts did n't be memorable for a long time . If you understand concepts , you can memorize for a long time . It show that boys and girls can understand concepts .  In addition , if they enter the university , they can be cpplicable other fields . When some students enter the university , they have troubles about their major . This is because they learn facts . As time goes by , students ca n't think about thing that they educated when they were in high school . However , other people get a chance to expand other field . Moreover , they can be applicable for their major . In the futy	KOR
Travelling is always an enjoyable , sometimes tedious , leisure acitivity . Nowadays , with travelling being such a normal thing to do , one is confronted with the choice of choosing between travelling with a group and , or by yourself .  So , can the one choice be better than the other ? First of all , most of the time , travelling with a group tends to be relatively cheap and with the tour guide usually being a local , allows the tourists to receive additional information during the trip .  Also , since the tour guide is doing this for his living , preferably as a professional career , it is ensured that the quality and quantity of the information given during the trip will be better than a tour organised by one 's self .  Secondly , a point that is often missed is the socialising factor . While travelling with a group , it is impossible for one not to get to know anyone . It is not a given though , that one 's fellow cohorts is as gregarious as one 's self .  Lastly , efficiency is the key , meaning so much as : Seeing a lot with little time . This allows the traveller to see as much as possible in a limited time . On the other hand , efficiency , such as many other things , is a double-sided sword . Being as efficient as possible prevents the tourist from savouring his moment during his travel , such as Mt . RUSHmore for example .  On the other hand , travelling without a group releases the tourist from the shackles of time . One can enjoy every moment of the tour , go back to an exhilirating sight , or just relax for a day - freedom is the key element here .  Informing one 's self is of the essence when travelling without a tour guide though , since nothing can be worse than a tourist without an idea what he is doing . This does n't mean that one may not opt for a private tour guide though .  Of course , all of this comes with a price . With this one can conclude if one wants a truly informative and economically feasible trip one should opt to travel with group . Yet if one wants to truly appreciate the true enjoyment of travelling , savouring every moment of one 's trip , then one should opt for the other .	GER
Have you ever experience it ? Helping ohteres often gives you a special feeling of joy and confidence . But I think nowadays only a few young people have experienced it . Many young people do not give enough time to helping their comunities .  Let us begin with an example in my own community . When I take a look at the group sise of our local Red Cross facility , I could see a continually decreasing of members . Sometimes we did n't know how to fill the sceduals . One reason for this is maybe the little time many students and peoples have nowadays . If you want to compete for a good job or a high education you have to work hard and so you have less time for other things .  But when we take a closer look , everybody should have more free time than it used to be . Many new inventions let us complete everyday routines much quicker , for example computers and telecomunications .  I think the real problem today is the change of lifestyle . It seems like every day we get a new possibility how to use our free time , for instance waching the lates movie or getting to the newly opend bar in the city . Young people do help in their comunities because they think they have to try all these posibilities .  But all these new things does n't improve your feeling of confidence . When some people would get acive in their community they would experience how much fun it is to help . In conclusion I agree to the statement but I think helping in communities could be easily improved if people try it .  you are often more often give you more happiness than do thomet	GER
I agree is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . I think you have to know the source of the facts not only the answer . The how and why is important to understand the fact . I think is more important understand concepts and ideas for two reasons : You know the source of the fact and you learn more about one topic .  First , when you understand ideas and concepts from the beginning you are able to understand the fact better . When you only know the fact you ignore how start . For example you know that a earthquake is danger and the earth move , but if you know the concept and the idea you can take precaution and stay save , even you can move to some place where dont have earthquake .  Second , this help you to study and learn about one materia . You can answer how and why and this is going to give you a deep knowledge about one area . For example you know if you put the hand in the fire you going to burn . If you know the concept and the idea you know what to to after the burn . Maybe you need go to the hospital or only put an antibacterial oinment .  In others word know the concepts an ideas give you an extraordinary advantage over the students only learn facts . You know how , why and	SPA
Travelling has become part of our living such as eating , drinking , exercising etc . . But why do people travel a lot nowadays ? FirsfThe reason why people are willing to travel is to be open to other cultures and traditions , they can also meet other people from a different ethnic background or religion in order to exchange new ideas and form opinions from all that or simply take a short period of time to relax and that is called ` vacation ' .  In fact , when we decide to travel , we usually need someone to lead us otherwise we 'll get lost and be deceived , moreover we might also find it really tiring and fruitless since everything is new to us we need some time to get accustomed to that new country . On the one hand , we can buy guiding books and maps and on the other hand we can hire a tour guide . Which one of the above means is effective ?  In my opinion , a tour guide is necessary because he can be really helpful by making us visiting the most interesting spots or the famous ones and it 's easier of course as we wo n't to rent a car or look for taxis everytime we need to visit a new place . Moreover , he 'll be well acquainted to his native country and tell us additional things that sometimes are n't revealed in books and we can ask him all the questions we would like to ask whereas by using a book , we do n't get really satisfied with the results and it does n't all that huge amount of information given by that guide . Another interesting point is the reason why people prefer travelling by groups instead of travelling alone is because they just want to enjoy their times and leave some souvenirs of that trip .  At last , according to my experiences , i would suggest that the best way of travelling would be in groups and guided by a tour .	FRE
Everyone has different opinion , it depends on different backgrounds . The one who agree that travel should let by a tour guide may think it will save more time , much cheaper , and effeicent . The others think travel by themselves maybe a better choice , they think they can travel by their own plan , do whatever they want . By comparing the pros and cons , i think the former one is better and more instriument to led by a tour guide . I will explian it and give some concrete examples .  Firstly , led by a tour guide will save much more time . Let us image , we walk in a fablous city , we appreciate the amazing views , the lake is so beautiful , the weather is so nice , and we just walk and walk without stop , finally we can not even move a feet , after whole day walking , we just see the nature view of the city . The city is big , and we are small , it is impossible for us to reach every corner of the city , we do not know which place is famous , which way is a shortcut , which bus we should take . However if we have a tour guide , everything will become easy . The tour guide will lead us to the interesting places , some famous , but more importantly some others we will never have the chance to know or find them if we do not have a tour guide , the guide will aslo tell us how to get there , which bus should we take . Is not great feeling that you do not need think anything , but just have fun .  Secondly , it will save more money . The tour guide always have some discount from the majority hotels and suites , they can easily book a room with a lower price . They can give us many coupons when we buy something .  Thirdly , it consider more efficient . We can visit much more places than we do not have a guide . When we arrive at the airport , there is a bus just outside waiting for us ; When we go to a resturant , the meal is ready for us ; When we need to leave , someone is telling us .  Last but not least , we can share our experience with other group members , we can easily find some to take a picture for you .  In conclusion , to travel in a group led by a tour guide can save more time , save more money and help you arrange things more efficently .	CHI
Is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ? there are going to be millions of places that you may have not seen or never heard before , new cultures to explore , new ways of learning of doing something that probably you did n't even thought it existed .  Traveling with a tour guide it 's probably a good choice if your idea is go and see the city , to know waht it 's the history behind it , but if your thing it 's not that than it 's not a good choice traveling with a tour guide .  In my personal experiences i had always wanted to see the cities for myself , but in my case i 'm also more intersted in the nightlife too , so i thinking that i will not be taking the tour guide to a night out in the city which i prefer spending it with my friends out .  Another thing would depend on what it 's your perspective of viewing things and on your own personal way o thinking and also in the point of life that you are living , me as a student would prefer go with a group of friends and that 's it , but probably in 10 more years i would rather see the city , the history , what it consist of , than just another night out with the guys .  So what i 'm saying it 's that there are certain points of life were you want to do certain things or you do n't , traveling with a tour guide it 's great to see the city for what it is and not only an structure , for what people had lived before in there , so taking a tour guide will depend after all on what your main idea of the trip is , and what the whole point would be after everything !

Gone are the days when people used to say `` Jack of all trade and master of none '' . Today in this competitive era , the time has come when we should rephrase this popular saying that `` jack of all trades becomes the master . '' I feel that a person having wider knowledge succeeds in life . Although specialization is needed to excell in certain field but in the developing society where everyone is busy in the race of cats and dogs , one has to excell in every field .  We can take the example of so many scientific experiment which has led to a new discovery . Even a simple biological experiment requires the effort of people from different field such as chemist and physicist . Had there been no chemist to provide chemicals and reagents for purifying DNA and had there not been any physicist to develop machinery for us , we would not have sequenced the genetic material in us , and the use of these requires the knowledge of these area . The various exams such as the one i am giving also makes us realise that it is better to have broader knowldge of many academic subject .  Also , i feel that having a broader knowledge increases the learning and application power . We can think bigger and put in our vast knowledge to do great innovation . We should have general studies about the culture and history even if we study science . In various intervews and examination , the questionairre are not from what we have learned specifically but about our knowledge and i feel its good too because this can only tell how we know about things happening around us .  Broader knowledge not only help us lead a successful life but also make us an improved human being . It helps us in better understanding and thus leading a better life .	HIN
, It is the reality that on one can change the reality . On the other hand , there is a good way to alter reality in our mind . Advertisements are very effective way to create convincing thoughts about something . Every research about advertisements or advertised products indicated that advertisemments has power to manipulate the people 's thoughts regarding products .  In our Tv or Show Business times , many celebreties or popular people have been created by our Media , and it should be acceptted that we love this popular people and grant importance their ideas . So the company use and benefits from this situation .  you can see many different actors , actress and singers as part of advertisements . I believe that if a one loves the Micheal Jackson and and saw the Micheal Jackson in the Pepsi 's advertisements , after this instance , Pepsi strongly take its place his or her mind .  Secondly , Advertisements introduces the products withhout presting their pejorative sepeciliaties . For instance if buy the microwave oven , you can not nuke something it near the baby or radition sensitive people . But it is impoosible to see any warning regarding microwave radition in the advertisements .  In Sum , Advertisements is very powerfull tools for affecting people ' thoughts about specific product . Researhes and statistics indicate that advertised products are more popular than not advertiseed products . Sellers and companies use celebries in order to affect people and they avoid to state the negative realities about product .	TUR
I agree with this satement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , because of following reason .  There are many accidents concerned with over advertisemnts in recently . Because of development of internet , people can buy goods any time they want . this convenience cause many troubles . People depend on information provided by others who people not know at all . But , they have confident information includeing advertisnements on not only internet but also magazines and CMs , because people have not other informetion . So , not only I but also many people feel It is not as wellas the advertisement said .  In fact , I have an experience . I like to read books and I found an article in internet about a book to find grest book . The book was wriiten about history in which I am imterested . I found , bought , and read it . However , all I found is this book is boring . the reason I want to read this is the words : this book make a big change on your life , becasue storys i theis book were written interestly . I do not like study history but read about history . I excited it must be written like novels , but the book like a textbook I used in class . So , since this time , I do not buy any books which I can not see the surface .  Because of the reasons , I agree with that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are . Additionally , compernyes try to make products seems much better . This is also the reasons to make people feel that this is good product .	JPN
traviling is a very nice thing , it hepls you see new coultcurs and to meet new poeplo , there are alot of ways for traviling and i believe that the best way is to travil with a group led by a tour guide , becuse when you go to a new country u will need someone to gide u aroud u will never know where to go or what to do alone only if u had someone to guide u to show you the best and the most important parts of the city you are in the guide will have a plan to show you every thing in the city so u wont miss a thing and also if u needed a help he can help u or if u dont speck the languej of that country you are in he can help u with that to for exaple if u were in paris and u dont speck french what can u do if u were alone ?? at that time a guide would help you alot , and to be with a gruop is so much fun than beeing alone thats where u can meet new people make new friendes and enjoy your time and its also much cheeper to travel with a group rather than traviling alone so it would save you alot of monye to for example if wanted to go anywere u will have to take a cab but if u were with a group u can go on the bus it would be much cheeper , thats why i agree that traviling with a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travil .

I do not agree with this statement , cars have been the most effective tool of tranport for half a century . I do n't think tools , such as airplanes , ships , or any other can easily replace cars in twenty years .  Cars nowadays need petrol as feul , this has become a great problem because the amount of petrol we can gain access to is limited on out planet . Lots of scientists say that as long as we do n't find other effective fuels for cars , we would n't be able to drive in a few decades . However , corporations such as Toyota , Ford , Hyundai and many others have developed their technology to use hydrogen and electricity as the main power source of cars . Thease cars do not require petrol , and therefore we will not need to find a substitute for cars in twenty years .  The world has grown rapidly during the past century . cities expanded its sizes and population saw growth in most cities . This growth brought new needs to people , a fast and cheap transport . Cities have grown enormously , places that we can go in 30 minutes by car would take us a few hours or more on foot . Cars have become a necessary element in modern society . The world is keep growing , cities are becoming even larger , and population is still growing , especially in India and China . The growth the world will see in twenty years will bring more and more needs for cars . Also , cars will become cheaper over time , as it did for the past decades , and it will allow people that could n't afford cars to buy them , Cars will become more necessary over time .  During the growth in the past few decades , our cities have developed in a way which it can allow cars to transport most efficiently . Cars were allways taken into consideration , we have roads , underground passges , bridges , parking lots , and all kinds of systems for cars . This system has layed its roots deeply into our cities , and unless we change this whole system during the next twenty years in our cities , cars will still be the most efficient way of transporting , and people will not stop using them .  Cars have been by our side for half a century , it has made transport much easier and faster , and it is also becoming cheaper , which allows more people to afford them . As long as there are n't huge changes , or as long as we do n't creat a more effective tool than cars , cars will still be in use around the whole world twenty years later .	KOR
The issue at hand is whether successful people should take risks or do what they already know how to do well . The issue is important because we are faced with a lot of daily `` risks '' in this manner . I believe that one should try new things and explore all the oppurtunities around him/her . I believe this because ' life is full of risks and if someone ( a successful person ) does not take any risks , then he/she will end up losing/missing a lot of good oppurtunities that the life brings in .  First of all , I believe that all the risks generally offer a great benefit in return . If one does not want to take any risk , he/she will receive no benefits . For example , a bank offers you a new type of bond which can bring you an additional income of 1000 $ per year . That is great ! Why not go get it , and go for a 100 $ bringing '' safe type '' because `` you already know how to do it well '' . In my opinion , a person who goes for a 100 $ is not aware of his/her abilities , and it is a shame to not to take a risk . In my view , a successful person would never miss it , and that is why they are called successful !  Secondly , life is full of risks and one can not be successful by choosing to stay conservative . Everyday , life brings in thousands of new oppurtunities to a lot of people and most of those oppurtunities can add beauties to your life ( of course not everything is related to money ) . For example , take a risk and join a good club to meet new people : beauties can be in terms of friendships , why not ? That is why , I believe that a person who always goes for what he/she already knows can never discover new oppurtunities in life , but a successful person utilizes these oppurtunities in all the good ways .  Finally , in my opinion , successful people do not lose oppurtunities . When one observes , I believe that one can infact detect successful people by detecting their risk-taking behaviours . Successful people are generally the ones who not only takem but `` catch '' more risks .  To summarize , I would like to say/and suggest that everyone should take more risks to be more successful . Taking risks will always bring them better things in many ways that will make them successful . If Napoleon Bonapart was alive , I believe he would say `` risk , risk , risk , success , success , success '' instead of `` money , money , money '' .	TUR
Someone might say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . I personally agree with this statement . I know that there are many examples that seem to prove the contrary but I think that they are absolutely not the norm . A young person is far more athletic and healthy than an older one . And , thing not to undervaluate , it has less responsibilities . When you get rid of all the things you have to worry about , life becomes instantaneously more enjoyable . So less responsibilities , less things to worry . Another reason is obviously the atletic stae of the body . At a certain age there are just a lot of movements you have difficulties to do , so even a simple action like , for example , riding a bike or running becomes hard to do .  And when you can not do such basic movements you can not accomplish more complicated tasks . Health is another important factor . Who enjoys going to the pharmacy or , worse , to the hospital ? Older people have to take care of their body continously , maybe taking pills or other medical treatments of some sort . And when you are not at that point , you know that sooner or later you will .  But the body is nothing without the mind . It 's scientifically proved that at a certain age the mental abilities of an individuos start to decrease dramatically . This has consequences on the whole body activity but let 's just concentrate on the mind aspect . Even those activities which do n't involve physical activity are precluded .  A chess match , crosswords , and any other kind of that stuff . This problems listed here are all problems that a normal person would n't have if he or she is young . So the conclusions are that when you are in the middle of you youth ( and do n't have any serious problem of other sorts ) , you have all the doors open and that these doors keep closing while the years pass by .

In my opinion the staement listed on the right does n't consider the reality . The world is turning into a medical knowledge world . By that I mean that medication in this year saves thousands of people in the world . The death rate in the world is decreasing time after time . Nowadays we can compete with nearly all infections in the world , accept the HIV virus . But as we all know , also the HIV infections in the world are decreasing . People do care more about their health . The government encourages smokers to quit smoking , the USA helps other countries by providing them food . This all leads to an increase of population in the world .  Another aspect is that freedom of opportunities . In our year we do n't have slavery or other criminal actions , besides war , that can lead to death . The USA and other countries provide starving African kids with food and medication . They also teach them the knowledge which is general to us , for example using a condom to prevent the most known virus in the world HIV .  More High Economic Countries help citizens of countries with lower economy to share tequinical knowledge , which helps these citizens to grow their economy . Thus the people have a longer living time .  Through all these factors in my opinion people will drive more cars than today . Cars get cheaper , because the production of cars will get easier with new tecnology . Thus people will buy more cars or some might have more than one car for themselves .  In short term , when the population of the world increases the more cars we will have in twenty years . We all know that it is comfortable to drive a car to get from one point to another . This will in my opinion not change in the next twenty years .	GER
I really agree with the statement . In Italy , the place where I live there are a lot of advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are , I hope these advertisements will disappear because I think that the the way how people spend money it 's not a joke .  I could write a lot of examples about these stuffs . I have a friend , Kate , she bought a shower gel that ensure her body skin to become smooth just like silk , but it is n't the truth ! Another example could be the lcd televisions that clerks encourage you to buy with the promise of a great view and a lot of light , but then you discover that you need to submit a new pay-per-view frequence to see it .  In past I had a lot of argues with people who sold these kind of stuffs . I do n't want to say that is always the same , sometimes there are a lot of things that seem to be great trought advertisement and after you buy them you discover they are really pretty good .  In my life I do n't like lies , and I do n't like liar people , and I really hate who promise you something and then you discover it was just a bad lie , and I think that these people deserve law judgment and to go in jail especially when they handle other people 's money .  I think that in the time that we live with a lot of diffusion it 's important for economies to be clear , because having a clear economy is the first step for people to trust in their own governments and make world works in the right direction .  In my opinion it 's important to have laws that allow people to trust in advertising and made advertisements clear and sure for people who buy someting without bad surprices .	ITA
`` Enjoy when you can ! This is one of the quotes , many people put as their favorites . Many people enjoy their lives , not regarding of how old they are , what kinds of situations they are in , or how rich/poor they are . All people can actually enjoy their lives if they see their lives in positive ways and put effort to make it colorful by experiencing varieties of different activites and challenging many new things in their lives .  Happiness comes along with the way how you see and think of it . If human-beings see the world in positive ways , they could always find more enjoyment in their lives . Being with families and friends can bring the joyful times to them .  Anybody can enjoy life if they want to . In these days , there are so many older people , doing what only young people could do back in the days . As the society develops and many new technologies are invented , there are now more activities old-aged can enjoy too . For example , the government is introducing more jobs and hobbies for older people to enjoy .  Enjoying life is not depended on the ages or situations people are belonged to . It does not matter how old they are . It matters with how they decorated their lifes with many experiences and challenges .	KOR
The speaker hits truth when he says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Commercials were originally a mode of informing consumers about the availability of a product . But over the years , the sheer innocence of an old banner proclaiming the opening of a new KFC restaurant in the neighbourhood has been lost in the relentless wrath of commercialisation .  Today , a commercial informing the viewers of what the product actually is would not even be noticed , much less lure prospective buyers to a hopeful brand . In the deadlock of efficient brands we find ourselves in today , advertisements need to be one step ahead of each other , a phenomenon previously seen only amongst the firms employing them . And this very much involves enhancing the features of the product they endorse .  The world of advertising revolves around competition offered by others , and that has brought it to such a stage where enhancing a product is a common practice . Probably the most appropriate example would be that of a recent advertisement my eyes fell on a few days back . It promised of a `` mansion draped in greenery '' , but the actual house was ironically different . It was a modest two bedroomed flat , hardly something you could refer to as a mansion . But sometimes advertisements cross the limits of what would still be classified as acceptable . Perhaps the most blatant of these are the ones employed by the automobile industry . In a recent controversy , one automobile dealer in New Delhi was fined and barred from operating for a year because he had promised a prospective buyer a sedan , which turned out be be a mess of pure lies and thievery .  Although sheer malpractice is evident in this `` enhancement '' of products , some people still advocate the validity of these advertisements . A recent survey in the United States of America brought to light a staggering number of people who see nothing wrong in this new trend . It only goes to show one thing ; that we have learnt to live with it and although unwanted , it has become an integral part of advertising today . So much so , that all you need to do to be sure of it is look into the local newspaper . Even though it might not tickle our fancy , if statistics are anything to go by , this practice is here to stay .	HIN
I have a quite open opinion about the statement that `` In twenty yearsthere will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' . On the one hand I would totally agree this . Each day you can read somewhere in the newspapers , how the prices if petroil increase from day to day . Petroil reached his highest price and there might be no decrease in the next years . As well as the limited oil reserves which begin to reduce every hours , it will be difficult to drice a car . Perhaps people will wake up and use the public transports , like the bus or train . That would lead to a better environment , because pollution and noise would reduce . As we could also see with the transrapid the public transportation development is great .  On the other hand we all see that there is no ending of new car producing . Nearly each inhabitant over 18 - years has once drove a car . Unfortunately for a lot of people , cars are a symbol of standard and lifestyle . They like to express their positon in the society . Some also dont want to give up driving a car , because it is a comfortable way of getting somewhere quick and easily . for a lot of people , especially men , cars are more than only a thing to transport them . It is a playing thing , which they like to show and compare with others .  Conclusively , I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years because some people in future have to stop driving their own cars . Insurance and petroil will become too expensive , when the prices will further increase .	GER
Learning is a very big process , The more we learn much more is left out to learn , it is an endless process . The adcademic subjects are meant to learn many things that relate our life to the scuience and technology that we are using to lead our life .  In school we study common subjects like english , mathematics , science , social etc which make us learn the basics related to the subject . By the end of our schooling we will have some knowledge about what each subjects describe and we will be left out to choose few subjects to continue our studies .  It is better to have knowledge about all the academic subjects than to specialize in one subject . It is essential to know about each and every subject as we implement all the subjects in our lives and we should have some basic knowledge about them .  After reaching to certain level of learning in all the subjects with our own interest we can emphasize on learning one particular subject . This will build self confidence in us and improve our skills as we try to learn things on self preparation .  We can take the theories provided by people who worked in the subject which we are interested and study them to give solutions to the problems which were not given by them . This will make us learn new things related to the subject and improve our skills in a better manner .  Working in a single field is often said as research work . This needs dedication towards the work and patience in doing the work . Its takes much time to present a thesis on a particular topic , even few years . This can be acheived only after passing certain stages of learning so in begging its better to have comprehended knowledge on all the subjects and as we move on in our life we can learn and dedicate ourself to a single subject .

That is right that some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I will explain in this writing which is my opinion .  I am 18 years old and then I am just an adult . That means that I heard this statement there is not a long time . In fact , all grandparents or parents said that their children do not do all they must do for the community . Then they think that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities . They always said that their childhood was more difficult than it is for us . It is very boring when all the time parents are against you do or have done . That is why , I am disagree with this statement . I will explain much better the reasons in a second paragraph .  This statement is for my opinion wrong . In fact a lot of people help old age people when they need some help . They often help their parents at home and they do a lot of activities . I think that help the community do not you ? Going to school is not really helping the community at the begining . But if young people do not do studies the community will fall down because we need people who have done a lot of studies to manage the other .  For my point of view old people think that because they do things which do not do . Like to go to see old people in their house , doing activities for their town like organize the next party . .. That are activities that we do not have any time to do . Because between the courses , the sport and generally social activities it is difficult to find a moment to do what they do .  As a conclusion , like you have seen I am really disagree with this statement . And I do not like when my grandmother said me that !!!!!!!!	FRE
I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .  In my high school in California , lots of students form the small tutoring groups in order to help those students who have questio in perticular subjects or who live in pool families . They meet everyday after schools in the library , not only studying their homework but also helping other students . Yet there are some students who could n't pay the money to the test-prep schools or the college-prep program in community college ; those who formed the tutoring groups would answer almost all the question those helpless students have . I was one of those helpless students because I just arrived from foreign country ; however , they helped me improving my English ability . Now I participate in the group and teach other students in Math and Chinese . As young people , I think my classmates and my friend all did a good job in helping the communities . I believe that there are other students groups in other schools that are doing the same job .  In summer time , most of my friends would participate to take care of the children or old people . Some of those children have no parents , some of them were abandoned . Once a time I participate in the service , I read stories to them . At first I was thinking of practicing my English reading ability ; however , I cry after I went home because I feel I want to do more for them but I could n't . I asked more of my friend to join this service , and we all learn different thing from it . One of my friend she had once participate in a service in a hospital . She talked to the old people , and then she read the books and newspapers to them . She told me that , participating in a community service was a really different expericence , and it would lead you to lear more about life , about helping other people but not asking the reward of it .  Young people do participate to help their community without speaking of it loudly ; they chose to help the society silently . Once they join it , they would continue the service .	CHI
Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects plays essential role in our lives . Broad knowledge effects our analysis of events and it also determines how we will think in certain situations . It is difficult to think about the topics that you have not heard before . You can not even express your feelings without having knowledge about that topic . It is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one subject . Specialization would restrict your world views and also it is difficult to decide in which subject you are going to specialize so in that case you would lose your other chances .  Specialization should occur after the broad knowledge of many academic subjects . For instance I am studying International Relations and my department underlines the importance of having broder knowledge . I could not just focus on Cold War without having knowledge of the results of First World War . Also the broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you to analyze the events in different dimensions , With the broad knowledge that I have , I can analyze the actions of states in different aspects .  In addition ; if you specialize in one specific subjects , you would not even know so many things about other subjects . It seems dangerous . It is difficult to face with a subject you do not have any opinion . Also , examples can be given from daily life . For instance ; you can be an excellent cook but it would have no worth if you did not know how to wash the dishes . It would complement each other . This is the simple example but it reflects the importance of having broad knowledge .  Finally ; with the broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people will have chance to see events in different perspectives even reading newspaper ; they can create relations with other events strongly . Also it is difficult to choose a one important subject for specialization . Specialization can only be achieved after broad knowledge of many academic subjects but broad knowledge can not be achieved after specializing in one subject .	TUR
The integral development of a human being is closely related with learning . Learning is a process that accompanies us until the day of our death .  Personally the fact of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject  Depending on the field , knowing about a variety of matters will give the person a broader overview of the topic in which he is trying to specialize . The knowledge of more fields than the one he is interested in will give him more possibilities to link his necessities with a particular information available .  The more skills a person gets will allow this person to perform in more fields . Not necessarily mastering all of them , but knowing enough to face any situation .  On the other hand , the ones who focus their energies on a particular subject are being on the risk of becoming too good on the preferred bussiness that can not draw their attention to something else productive and constructive as well . The neurosurgeon who has a flood in his house will not be able to handle emergency scenarios like this because of his total ignorance about plumbing . I would not say that all neurosurgeons are urged to take a plumbing course or something similar , but the point is that knowing some basics about how to use this tools or being aware of the water or sewing system around the house this person will be ready to perform first-hand measures to save his house until getting specialized help .

I do not believe that the given statement is true . Indeed , I understand the logic which lies under that assumption but personally , I do n't have the impression that it is a veracity .  First of all , it is important to analyse why someone who only meets success is more likely to take risks than somebody else . As a matter of fact , when you succeed a project , you feel satisfied . The more you achieve what you want , the more you become confident . Then , it is like a spiral : the more you get , the more you want to get . In fact , when you plan to start a business and it works well , you think about expanding your activities . If it works and you are already at the head of a big company , you may diversify your business . That is why big companies like Bouygues are in building , mobile phones and so on . Virgin makes discs but also develops its own mobile phones programs . Those companies take risks , while entering new markets . They believe in their success because they are supported by their customers .  However , new things are not always done by successful people . Creativity , for instance , has nothing to do with sucess ; it is about personality . So an artists does not always meet success . Nonetheless , his or her desire to create will still go on . That explains why a lot of painters did a lot of breakthroughs after many failures . Another example is Alain Baraton , a famous gardner in Versailles . He has failed during his school years but then , while he worked in Versailles he developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangements around the castle . Besides , you can not be successful all the time but it does not means that you are less willing to do new things . In addition to that , someone , who really wants to be recognised by the society and has never achieved that goal , will probably try everything he or she can .  As a conclusion , success is not so closely tied to ` boldness ' as the statement suggests .	FRE
This is a very important issue with respect to the community and the youngsters who are part of this community . The issue which does need the attention and analysis . Although it is not that whole young crowd has become indifferent to helping the communities but i certainly believe that looking upon it wholly , the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping the communities .  There are several reasons for my acceptance of the statement and i would like to state them in the following paragraphs .  The main reason i feel this is because todays youngsters have become too narcissists . They are all self-centered and bothered about their personal progress . This is due to the ever increasing competitiveness . In this competitive world , to catch up with the pace each youngster is busy polishing himself/herself for the contend . And in this course he remisses the community . He is too worried about his own progress and achievements to look into the community matters . Each of them wants to be the best and they dont want to afford wasting time on others .  The other reason which makes me accept the statement is the prevalence of the corruption , violence , robbery , murder etc and whole lot of crimes taking place . If the youngsters gave enough time to the well being of the community , would n't be the scenario different ? All those murderers , robbers , rapists constitute of whom ? Are n't the major chunk of them the youths of the community . Instead of being helpful to their community they are becoming the cause of all sorts of sufferings and traumas to the community , i must say .  Further , i feel that youngsters are not contributing to help the community because they are getting away from moral values and disciplines of the society . Todays youngster want to be more independent and does not want to be taught all those lessons of helping others . What he learns from the todays growing technological world is how to make himself modernize and how to cope up with rest of the competitors . Admist this , he does not cares for the community . For example , today most of the young people spend half of their time on internet . Now , by exploiting internet what are the possibilities of them using it for other 's sake or to help someone compared to the possibilities of chatting , browsing , looking for job opportunities , searching for institutes for further education etc . Certainly , the probablities of utilizing it for personal benefits is quite higher .  All these reasons and examples make me accept the statement that nowadays , youngsters are not much interested and hence not devoting much time to help the community . This can be attributed to their ignorance about the well being of others and zeal for personal holistic development .	HIN
Today we live in a world where everything is fast and in movement . To attract the consumers attention often the advertisement made by the productor , or a company , is better then the product itself . I totally agree with this statement because we can have examples of it everyday ; it is sufficient to go in a supermarket and have a tour to see that it is full of similar products , and the only difference between one and another is made by his advertisement .  Another example can be taken from the television : there are a lot of advertisements made only to catch the consumers attention . There are a lot of ways to catch the consumers attention : some products and , obviously , their advertisements look to the history of the company who made it , like a `` design '' object , others tend to be new and innovative .  I think that an advertisement should show the real potential of a product , without exagerations , in order to prevent unhopefull cases of recriminations and also a bad notoriety of it .  The failure of a product must not be a stymulus to create a false advertising in order to selling it : it must be a motivation to improve it . Because now our life is , for the most part of it , in movement , advertisement had begun to be greater and greater . When we are blocked in the traffic of the city , big advertisements try to catch our attention with provocations and funny phrases . But not everytime what is showed is good as his advertisement . In conclusion I think that who made an advertisement should be sure of what he , or she , wants to sell and what is the real potential of the product .	ITA
Me as many other students face the decision either to have a general knowledge about many accademic fields or to specialise in one field only in order to be considered an expertise . The decision that will come out will reflect the characteristics of the person . A person with many interests will never renounce to the pleasure of knowing more and more different things . On the other hand , people with a passion will tend to specialise in a field that will make them happier and happier .  A general education has many positive aspects such as a greater flexibility in changing preferencies and visions for the future . This kind of preparation gives the possibility to the students with no clear ideas about the future to postpone this important decision and take time to identify the main desire . Furthermore , a general education gives much more flexibility in adapting to different job conditions .  A specific education focused only on a subject gives the advantage to the student to be an expertise in a field . This is a great advantage on the job market . In the same time , these students usually are much more rigid , unable to change and to handle with changes . These characteristics are not always required by employers .  Personally , i think that the best choice for a person would be a solution that takes into account both its own personality and the inner desires , for this reason i do not think there is only one best education . Furthermore i think that the accademic education that must be followed should reflect the requirements of the field that the student is studying , we can not compare the specificity required in medicine by the doctors with the general culture required by an teacher .

Nowadays , it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject . Before applying students should take following aspects in consideration .  Firstly , it is often mentioned that being a specialist of a certain area makes it easier once you finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation . However , having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads . Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily . Once you are received the job you still can and you even have to , no matter being a specialist or a generalist , adopt to tyhe needs of the company you are working for .  Secondely , it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas . To some limited extend there is some truth in it , but , undoubtely , experience shows that no metter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same . Nevertheless , doing a generalistical degree is in my point of view better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time . In other words your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only being specified . And the time you have spend remains the same .  To summarize , students first of all should be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they obtained a degree in a specific subject . Furthermore they should mistrust the rumour that studying with the objective to get a broad knowledge of many academic subjects takes the same time then it would achieving a specific degree .	GER
Nowdays , advertisements are a key element of trade business . Indeed , advertisements are always used as a mean to improve sell of goods . Some persons think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I agree with this statement .  The reaon why advertisements were invented is to increase the level of sells . Therefore , advertisements promote products and must convince the buyer that he needs the promoted products . To this aim , the products are presented as the best product ever invented eventhough it is often false . Advertisements are created to attract customers , to make them buy the proposed products .  For instance , it is common to see on television advertisements which explain that the presented product has been tested by a certain number of customers who expressed their satisfaction when they used the product . However , there is no proof of such study and those results can not be ascertained .  The promoted product must appeal to the customer and therefore , lot 's of technological means are used in order to improve the picture of products . Indeed , nowdays , lot 's of software are invented in order to fix pictures , to erase some elemets of the pictures . To some extent advertisments are often diffused on television , the best way to attract customers is to show a beautiful product , with nice colours and nice shape .  For example , advertisemts often concern food products . When a cake is promoted , the nice colour of the cake will obviously attract the customer . In the same vein , the nice shape of the cake will also appeal to the customer . Therefore , the customer will buy the product , thinking that he will get the same article as the one exposed in the advertisement and he will be desappointed because the cake can not have , in real , the same colour as the one obtained thanks to informatic sofware used for pictures .  As a conclusion , advertisments are always using false information and it is difficult to put boundaries between well conducted advertisemenst and false information .	FRE
Some people may believe this is true , but I totally disagree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . From my point of view , I think that young people do not enjoy their life more than the older people do . First of all , young people have less spare time than the older people , because they are young , they have a lot of working pressures and long working hours . They must strive for their future by hard working Therefore , they do not have much spare time on what they are interested about . However , older people have less working responsibilities and they have less working hours than the young people do , and many of them are retired form their work . they can spend more time to stay with family and do many hobbies that they are intersted about .  Secondly . Older people have more friends than the young people do . As time past , older people have been in society for so many years , so they have met a lot of people , they can have fun with so many friends . It is really a happy thing to stay with many friends , and there must be a pleasant atmosphere .  Finally , they older people have less living pressures than the young people do . Many older people have already retired from their work . they did n't think much about how to keep their work and how to make more money . they have already done this when they were yong . now the only thing that they need to think about is that how they sepnd rest of their life to enjoy the wonderful things in the world . they can travel to many beutiful places in their spare time , moreover they can visits their friends and have fun with them . They do not think much about work , and just playing for fun . however , the young people will still face the heavy work and the pressure from the society . So , they can not enjoy themself as much as the older people do . Making my father and my grandmother as an example , my father work more than 40 hours a week to earn money to afford my study fee abroad , and he does not have much time to have fun . however , my grandmother have a lot of spare time and less working pressures , so she can play a lot of funny staff with her friends .  Therefore , from the reasons I listed below , I think that older people enjoy their life more than thhen young people do , because they have more spare time , more firends and less working pressures .

Although the basic concept of advertising is itself to promote a product or a service , I do agree with the statement that Most Advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are .  Advertising for products is essentially the process used to convince potential buyers that the product in question is fit and suitable and the best in the market . However most advertisements blow this definition completely out of propotion by marketing a product which ends up being radically different when finally used . The degree of exaggeration used in advertisements to convince the buyer is at times ridiculous . Advertisements in the fast moving consumer goods domain especially strictly adhere to the policy of displaying a completely wrong image of the products which make them seem much better than they actually are . An example that comes to mind is a commercial for a leading shampoo product which claims to not only put hair back on the heads of of its balding users but also rejuvenate them to the extent that they will be able to compete with the best drivers in the world on a formula one car racing track .  Advertisements in various other sectors also mislead users to believe that the product will offer qualities that it was never designed to provide in the first place . Although one of the selling points of a good advertisement is in some cases to provide a tinge of humor to go with the product , certain advertisements and brands use this to the extent that make their products seem too good to be true . Various mail order catalogs for exercising systems are also another a clear example of how the end product differs vastly from the advertised one  Especially in today 's wolrd where common opinion has it that media over powers print , people look to advertisements especially on television , to help them make informed choices about which product suits their needs better . This dependency may not be large when it comes to everyday products , but in cases of products which are highly expensive and involve large investments , some advertisements can often mislead people 's desicions . An example to illustrate this are the advertisements for real estate projects or finance and tax saving instruments and more recently even in job searching portals . Some of the advertisements have caused people to make incorrect decisions due to their assured but unrealistic claims .  All in all , my belief is that advertisements should help people make informed choices and should make people aware of the product . A certain degree of humor and make believe is alright but the core functionality of the product itself should not be made a fantasy as is the case with many of the advertisements in todays world . I therefore ardently agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	HIN
the statement says the young people enjoy more than older people . personally , i do n't agree this statment in all of this part . infact , by my points of view the young people is less responsable of other mature people . generally , in the last years the way to enjoy life is changed . infact today young peole have less problem than young people of forty years ago for example . today a boy depends totally from his parents . in this way he have less responsability and this caused a total insoddisfaction of all .  instead of the young people , the older people have achieved a total maturity that permitt they to enjoy life more than young people with small things , like a only dinner with friends or a travel with family .  it is also true that the young boys have a lot of enthusiam respect to older people . but this concept do n't go to over see the problem . there are also cases where older people do n't enjoy life beacuse they have very big problem like the fact of to not fand a work or for example because their are very tyred .  so , my personal opinion is that the young boy , in the state of parity of conditions , do n't enjoy life so much . infact also in my family i see that my parents enjoy life more than me and my brother . finally , in this way i say that i disagree with the above statement .

I agree with the statement mentioned that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . If students learn only facts then they do n't have conceptual knowledge or idea that where and how to use in practical . For example , a maths teacher taught one problem and solved without giving the concept of that problem like formula , method or steps to perform to solve the problem . This will be difficult for the students , if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination . They can not solve the problem as they do n't know the concept of the problem given . So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered , so that they can easily solve the any problems based on that concept .  For every problem there will be a concept behind to solve it . Another example as , if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter . In that there is a chapter calle `` GRAVITATION '' . In this the idea is about the Earth 's gravitation . Due to gravity whatever the things thrown in the air from earth 's surface it will fall on the earth again because of gravitational pull of the earth . If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from earth will fall back to the earth 's surface , then they just learn the fact . They do n't know the reason . Due to this type of learning none of the students will not become good engineers or any other professionals . Because lack of concepts and practical knowledge .  Even if we take a civil engineer student who do n't know how to build the building and where to build then definitely the building will be collapse .  That is why , it is important for the students to learn concepts and understand the ideas rather than to learn facts .	TEL
Cars were first introduced in the beginning of the last century . Ever since it has replaced the horse and carriage in most of the globe . The number of cars are in frequent increase . I do not see in the future or the next twenty years that the number of cars will drop . As a machiene , the car has proven to be invensible . It is very hard to imagine our lives without cars . Thus with the increase in the world population and the idea everybody needs a car then I do not see that in the next twenty years that there would be a drop in the number of cars .  Car polling is a subject being disscussed every where in the world . It is very essential to decrease the number of cars on the streets . This will eventually make the flow of cars in the streets smoother and easier . As good of a dream this is this will only make driving your car less of a hassel but will not decrease the number of cars .  I remember when my father was driving me to school . I was only six years old . Now I am eligible to drive and my father is still driving . This means that there are more than one generation of drivers on the streets driving there cars . Besides I no longer wants my father to take me to school . I want to drive myself .  Subways and undergrounds are very good ways to ease the problem of the traffic jamming , but it will never replace the car and this wh	ARA
`` Variety is the spice of life ''  The word ` success ' is not only associated with the work that you do but at the same time being successful in the new dimension that you have adopted in your life . I completely agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . This can be well explained by citing some examples of a few legends in different fields like the ones that have been mentioned below .  Firstly I would like to start with the richest person in Indian market Dhirubhai Ambani was once working as a vegetable vendor , he was a master of selling those vegetables no doubt , but drew interest in the communication field and started researching in that field . Its a completely different field that he opted for but the determination he had in his work and the confidence he had in his ability made him a successful person and finally he became the master in that field .  Secondly the all time legend in the field of cricket ` Sachin Tendulkar ' was pursuing his enginnerg because he wanted to become a successful engineer but had a lot of interest in cricket . So he opted for cricket after he got to enggineering , though it was a big risky decision that he had taken up , he was ready to work hard for that . And now he s a renown cricketer . The risk that he had taken was a huge one but it really paid him off .  Thus i certainly feel that a person who is versatile in his work and at the same time diversified in his thinking morals can become a successful person . Thus a succesful person is not the one who take risks but at the same time strives hard for that and makes his risky decision count at the end of the day .	TEL
Will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today ? What an important topic ! Indeed , the reduction or increase of cars , and their effects on the environment , are mainly discussed in our every-day conversation and political programs . As far as I am concerned , I agree that there will be fewer cars in use in the near future than there are today . Let me explain why .  On the first hand , the actual trend is that everybody ( the government , households and corporations ) has to take care of his or her environment , and it is going to be a real obligation in the next few years . Indeed , we all know that lots of things go wrong around us such like the global warming for example . Did you know that with this frightening global warming glaciers disappear and that can lead to the disappearance of the Maldives in less than twenty years for instance ? So the point is that if we do nothing , we are certainly going to lose our planet and we will have to find somewhere else to live ! It is terrible , is n't it ? The pollution contributes to the global warming and what is the primary source of pollution ? These are obviously cars and their CO2 . This gaz contributes too to many diseases . .. Therefore , cars have to be reduced .  Moreover , the other transportation modes are developing in an impressiove manner . Let 's take the example of Paris . We can notice that having a car is totally wrong with all this traffic in the streets ! Why do n't we take the bus instead ? At least we definitely know what time exactly we are going to arrive . Driving in Paris can take four or five times more time than taking the bus , for exemple .  Finally , questions of security became so important in our society . We should reduce the number of cars because of the too many accidents it occurs . It is unacceptable .  To conclude , I will just say that there is another solution : changing our actual polluting cars to ecological cars , which deeply consider and respect our environment . They can work with sun or non-polluting oils for example . I really think that this is the best solution since you can not order people to stop using their cars .	FRE
i think this is a general statement , and it is too difficul discussing about this without following in born tinks . however , i disagree with this sentence . firs of all because i know many boys and girls that do not enjoy in their eveerydays life . they seem to need ever something else , they are not able to be happy for what they do . everything becomes a problems : the wedding , the childrens , the job . i recognize the we live in a difficult time , the politic affairs and the economic once are not very good , and also there is the war . .. but i ask to myself : what are the differences between the actual and last times ? my father tolk to me about the second world war , and also about the problems the he had had for finding something to eat end than the problems he had had to take a job .  my father dead three years ago , but i think he enjoyned his life more than many young people . i want to talk about another point : the wedding . i see that many people now prefer the divorce to the possibility to solve the problems . i do not understood very well this position . for me having a family is a way to get better our life , but probably i wrong because many people i know do not think in the same way . i want to enjoy living alon or goin out untill 5 or 6 a.m. so they refuse the idea to build a family untill they are 35 or 37 years old .  probably i am the firs person that does not enjoy enaught her life . i try every day to put passion and love in what i do , specially from the time i live alone , now i have no fathter and no mother , but i see that if i am correct with other persons i am not alone .

A guided tour is always a preferd tour . A guided tour with a group is more fun , learning and longlasting . For example if you are travelling all alone to a historical monument with no background knowledge about the place . Its as good as seeing the monument/place in books .  If you are travell alone then things will be not be of greatet interest . There might be moments that you want to discuss with some one on a specific painting or architecture . This calls for a tour in groups rather then individual . A monument / painting speaks thousand words when you observe them but it can not listen to you .  There are some points of the guided tour that make it more intresting . First , the intricacy of the depth of the knowledge of the guide about the importance of the place , which obvioiusly we as a tourist are not aware of . Second , there are places that may not be listed or published in the maps , magazines , books etc and there might be some local place that might be of intrest which the guide knows . The third point is that in a group there are people with differnt ideology and thoughts . The inquisitiveness of any one in the group to know about some thing might prove to be useful for the entire group to learn more about the place . Obviously a guide is the best one to answer such questions . Thus a best way to travel is a group , led by a tour guide .  There is ofcourse , the other side of this where the guide might try to tell things differently and might say wrong things about the place . The guide might be prejudiced about some of the historiacl views and opinions . These are factors that depends on the type of guide you choose . If there is good guide with good reputation then it is always advantageous to hire him for a guided tour . If you consider saving the guide charges by not hiring him then the money spent on coming to the place may go in vain since you would have only visited the place but do not know any thing more about the place than what you have seen .	TEL
Based on my traveling experiences , I would say that , indeed , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . By traveling with an experienced person , you learn from that person 's knowledge of the place , and you are able to develop a deep and intelligent opinion about what you see and experience while traveling .  Two years ago , I visited New York with my family , and I was surprised by the great difference between traveling on your won or with a tour guide . While we were traveling on our own around the city , we realized that we were only wandering in the streets , looking at the tall buildings , but not learning anything interesting about the city ; besides , without an appropiate knowledge of the city , we had a lot of problems in trying to find our hotel after we walked some streets . The next day , we decided to pay a tour guide in order to learn more about the city and its most important touristic spots . With the help of the tour guide , we were able to know more about the city 's stories , important places , good restaurants , and many other useful facts that we would ignore if we had continued our self-guided and ignorant traveling . Traveling with a group led by a tour guide surely has more benefits than just avoiding getting lost in the streets : you learn more about the facts , the secrets and the essence of the place you visit .  Another example I can mention to reinforce my opinion about tour guides is the trip I made with my family to China last year . As I said before , with the help of a tour guide you can develop a deep and intelligent opinion about the place you visit . When we arrived to this Asian country , I had the idea that we were going to find poor people living under a communist regime ; after we traveled some time by ourselves , my opinion about this communist country did n't change . However , when we took our tour around Beijing , the guide began to explain the current situation of the country from the Chinese perspective . I was surprised by the significant knowledge I acquired about the Chinese culture after hearing the tour guide 's opinion of her country and the information she had regarding the situation of Communist China . After learning from this new perspective , which I may not have noticed without a tour guide , I was able to change my point of view about China , and to develop a more critical and intellectual opinion about the Chinese culture and current economic , political and social situation .  After traveling in New York and China in a group led by a tour guide , I reaffirmed my opinion about traveling about this kind of trips . I hold my position of complete acceptance for guided traveling . If we had not had the help of a tour guide , my family and me would never have been able to visit New York as a true New Yorker or to learn from the Chinese culture from a reliable and original source , an authentic Chinese tour guide .

I agree with the statement , mainly because I think that it is imperative for students to understand ideas and concepts and knowing how to act upon them is more important than just knowing facts .  From my experience in highschool , I think students in general find it much easier to just learn facts rather than understanding concepts and ideas . One simple example is when I used to love `` labelling the heart diagram '' in biology class but just despise explaning Newton 's First principle law of motion in physics class . On the contrary when there is a written response question on a test it would be much easier for students to respond when they actually understand what they are talking about rather than just knowing the fact .  Another broader example is when we had to make a student commitee with the job of spreding out the word in school of aiding with recycling and cleaning up . Many of us did it but I highly doubt that everyone understood why they where doing .  So in the end I believe for a student to get through his life experience as being a student with a degree of some sort , he has to understand idaes and concepts and act upon them .	ARA
During the last years , we have seen a big difference in the way of life of all people . A lot of events have occured during the 19th , like the world wars , the development of capitalism , the conflicts of religions etc . .. and all of that have modified our society in France , or in other countries . I will take for my exemple the situation in France . What happened in May 68 have contributed to change people minds . Before this period , young people were more obediant and structured in my opinion . Moreover , I think that they were generally less individualists than today . Capitalism have developped that feeling and the consequences of all that is the fact that young people are obsesed by their individual success because times are more and more difficult and people know that it will be certainly more difficult in the future . So young people are pressured and they are conscient that they have to succeed . They work harder at school or they have two jobs like I can see around me , and they have less time to make anything . To resume , I think there are two principal causes : one because young people are nowadays more individualists and do n't think in helping other persons , two because they have less time due to the new social model . However , we can see in a few situations that young people are able to help everyone that is in a difficult situation . For example , during the Tsunami , we have seen a lot of young people giving a gift to La Croix Rouge or other associations . Many of them have expressed the desire to go there to help people who were reached . In fact , we can see that these young people can help their communities when there is an accident . So we can say that it 's ponctual and they g can give the best of them at certain moments . But I think too that these type of population do n't make enough efforts to help other people who need their help .	FRE
Many people have the problem that they do not know what to do regarding the subjects they can choose form , in a universtiy . Should they take their time to study many acadamic subjects or should they specialize in one specific subject ?  The first positive point of choosing many academic subjects is , that you have a broad knowledge of many different thinks . That makes you more flexible when you look for a new job and also gives you more flexibility on many other situations . The second positive fact is that you are able to talk about many different topics , which can help you to increase your relationships with others . If a person talks about various topics you are able to enter the conversation because of the fact that you have more knowledge about different thinks . You are able to talk about many differnt thinks than a person who just study one specific subject .  To specialize on one specific subject has many positive benefits . First of all people who take many courses have not specific knowledge about a certain subject . People who specialize on one subject are more professional and therefore able to answer more specific questions because they have more knowlede . They are also able to use their knowledge to solve higher problems . Another positiv fact is that companies allways need professional people who have a lot of knowlede in a specific area . Therefore people are better paid than people who are not so professional .  I strongly belive that it is better to have more knowledge about a specific subject . You are more able to solve complex porblems and you are also able to answer to more specific questions . In addition people with more knowledge about a topic are more likley to get more money from companies because they need professional people .	GER
In my opinion , I agree that traveling with a group of people led by a tour guid is the best way to travel . There are several good reason why I agree with having a tour guid during the travel . First of all , when you will decide to go to a foreign country that you have not ever visit it , you will face some difficulties and a little bit of fear . All of these troubles that you will be faced because of the worryness and anxiety for this trip . Also , may be because you do n't have enough required information about that country . So you need some one to help you about the places , shopping malls , good restuarant , lacation of some hotels and so on . According to these challenges , the bast way to keep away these trouble is to travel in a group led by a tour guide who have enough information about the counry more than what you have . Second reason why I personaly prefer that because I think it is safer for you and your family . I rememberd when I and my family traveled to Italy , we encountered some criminals and drug people who we do n't know how to deal with them . However , although my father had solve this problem , I think if we had a guid with us that will be more easy for us . The third and last reason is we choose to travel to have some relax and have a rest away our works , duties and responsibilities . Actually , if you want to do that you should be away from all these troubles that , of course , you will be facing it such as ask some citizen people to have some information about as I said in the begining `` where can I find this hotel ? '' , `` where are the recreation centers ? '' , `` what is the best restuarant do you have here ? '' and lots of these dum questions . You may also do not know how to speak their language since you are not a native speaker .  In short , personally I prefer to travel with a tour guide to keep away all of these headach .	ARA
Some people think that , it would be better to have broad knowledge of different academic subjects because variations of subjects adds to human experience and provides possible solutions in many situations . Others think it would be better to concentrate on one topic and go on . Based on my experience , both opinion are helpful according to my grade .  When i was in under graduate school , I was fond of reading and attending different classes which helped me to great extend to pass my exams easily and receive high score .  On the other hand , when I was in physical therapy school I concentrated on only sports medicine classes which helped me to apply for master degree and find convineant job .  Finally both thoughts are important depend on needs and goals .	ARA
Things are changing every day . In pass 50 years , you could not believe that people can use the computers to do a lot of things . You could not believe somethings which is happend Today . So Young people is changing also , they enjoy their lives more than older people do . There are three points can prove this .  First , young people will not think about when they become old what will happen . They just want to enjoy their lives now . Prepare to the Older people , there is a big different . Older people will think about their family , their retire payment , their future lives . They will save money for that . They also will reduce their ativities for health . But young peope will not do that . They want to spend more time with friends . lovers and some modren things . They do not have saving account , they like use visa , and use more money in their habits . In fact , they do not have the plan for the future .  Second , Young people is more easier to pay attetion on some new things . They will be mad on computer game , cars , clothes and so on . At that time , they will spend more money and more time on it . Do not say i am young , i still have much time to do my future work . That is wrong , Because you do not have that money to enjoy your life . You only use older people 's money to enjor your life . Prepare to older people , their situation is opposite . They will not pay attetion on new things , they just want themsleves to have good final lives .  Third , Young people will not think about thier families , they think thier lives are more important . They will say i must enjoy my life without odler people . They do not want to stay with mother or father .  They only know friends . Althouht there have ages problems between oder people and young people and they will not enjoy life together , young people do not have any pionts about their family .  Anyway , YOung people	CHI
Advertisement is the product of highly sophisticated marketing techniques combined with the knowledge of the human psychology . Knowing how to advertise under these references makes it easy for companies to sell products that look very appealing but in actual fact are not their money 's worth . Throughout the history of industries , stores and products there have been unthinkable numbers of faltey and bad products that have consumed the markets and their customers in a raid .  For the famous company Apple who have produced and advertised an array of incredible products , there have been some along the way that were purely insignificant in contrast to their price . The first release of their Ipod was one of these products . When the Ipod was primarily released , the sales numbers hit a continuoes high that has not ended till today , but these `` first year '' Ipods were full of technicall errors . The Ipod batteries ( that were concealed in the inside of the Ipod ) broke after two weeks and lasted for an hour when they were maximum charged . Since the Ipod is one of the highest produced gadgets in the world , this problem occured with every Ipod within a few weeks of it 's purchase . Second , the Ipod headphones that came with it , blew out after listening to music the music with the maximum volume on your own Ipod . This was a big issue , since this showed that the headphones were not designed accordingly .  Although all of these faults were known , the Ipod sales did not decrease because it was the most prestigious gadget to own at the time . The design and marketing strategies led by Steve Jobs ( Apple 's CEO ) have influenced such emense groups of customers , from all ages to all places that the sales did not decrease . The fantastic and slik design contributed to this . The Ipod was three to four hundred dollers at the time and compared to other Mp3 players that were less expensive , it was not of higher standards and therefor not worth the money .  The marketing strategies that evolve around the advertisments of new products exceeds the basic knowledge we have about a product and makes it look of higher standards than it is . The products therefor are sold at prices that they are not worthy of and therefor corrupt the average customers payments . It is unfair but at the same time the customers fault for not researching the products enough before they purchase them .	GER
Some people think it is not necessary to learn many academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge from them . However I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Because we can use our broad knowledge to our real lives .  Firstly , some people think it is not necessary to have broad knowledge . Because they think it is waste of time and not necessary . Moreover , it is really hard to learn variety of subjects . For example , in Korea , Korean middle school force student to learn about 12 subjects . But it became a serious problem in that the education program does not consider student 's ability or interest . So recent research showed that more than 50 % of Korean middle school students are dissatisfied with their academic program and waste of time . And average 30 students are going to study abroad a day .  However , I think the broad knowledge that we have learned is very valuable in that we can use them someday . For example , I learned Home Economics and Technology in school . At first , I was suspicious about that why I have to learn about things that I am not interested and not valuable . But , one day , I had to cook food by myself because my parents were not at house . I could n't think any of them . And then , I could remember that I learned how to make a Korean traditional food called , `` Bulgogi '' . So I could realize the importance of broad knowledge .  Overall , I think it is better to learn various academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge in that it will helpful for our lives . Even though it is not related to one 's personal interest . In my opinion , even though people do n't feel the necessity of learning various subjects , it does n't mean that they wasted time . It has its meaning that they had tried .	KOR
In my personal experience , i agree that it is the best way to go on travel in a group that led by a tour guide . There were lots of advantages of go in a group . In this short essay , i will discuss with reasons and examples that why is traveling the best way within a group .  First of all , we can make a lots of friends during the trip . When we are on an airplane , a train , a boat or a bus . We can all commiuncate with each others , and having fun . One of my best friends , who names Kim , i met him the first time in a bus on a trip with a group to HangZhou , he just sits next to me , and we sarted to talk to each other , after all we became the best friends . So that traveling in a group can make friends .  Secondly , it is well organize by traveling with a tour guide . He/She could led you to the most popular and interesting place that the touriest always likes to go to . For example , if i go to place by my self that i never went on before , i wil totally get lost , and do not know where to stay and where to go and where to eat . .. so on . But if i go there with a group and with a tour guide , the things will totaly be changed .  Last but not least , we can get more fun by traveling in a group . For example , if i go to a place individually , i will get bord on the airplane or train . In the other hand , it will be more interesting and funny by traveling in a group , because sometimes we can talk about some funny stories or interesting personal experience on the trip , so we would not get bord .  In conclusion , i discussed the reasones and examples that why is travelng the best way in a group and b y a tour guide . In my opinon , i would like to travel in a group , cause i can make new friends during the trip .	CHI
In my opinion it is better to have knowledge of one specific subject extensively , rather than having some knowledge in all the fields . There are a few reasons namely - accuracy , dangers of half knowledge and specialization is only after some general knowledge - that i venture to opine in favour of specialization .  Firstly if a person is more widely knowledgable in the field of his own interest , he not only performs well but also is able to put in his own efforts in the form of information to be used more accurately . For example a doctor , if he is specialized in heart and its related aspects he is capable of helping a patient more efficiently than a general physician would .  Secondly like i said dangers of half knowledge are not unknown to us . If we have not mastered even one subject we can not put in any effort to get something out of our knowledge . We do not have a sense of direction in which to proceed also we have to stop in the middle of an invention or discovery because we do not know what lies ahead . This can also be decisive for the growth of a society on the whole .  Finally for any specialization to happen on any subject we start with a knowledge of various feilds related or unrelated which might help in the better understanding our field of interest so the knowledge of all academic subjects is in a way the foundation stone of any specializaion and is therefore a part of the learning process . Like i stated if it is a cardiologist in question then he would have some knowledge of the whole body functioning as that is evidently related .  Thus i can safely say that specialization not only helps in developing our skills in our own field of interest , it also is the destination for some knowledge that we acquire in all the subjects . Eventually helping us to mature as an individual , as an adroit in our field and in the growth of society on the whole .	HIN
Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , yes of course , i agree with this . The way advertisement used now a days as lost the meaning of its purpose , early days its pupose is to bring to the people , make people aware of that certain product is available in the market , which benefits the customers in different ways , in that advertisment they clearly give the description of the product , and way that could be used in real life .  The very purpose of that advertisement is lost now a days , they are just showcasing the product , then it orginally exhibits its characterstics , comparing it with other product and fooling the public of the worthiness of the product , then really it has .  They use some girls , for advertising face creams , before they use this product they look not beautiful , but using the products for a few time brings chane in them itseems , they wiil be looking charming , how this happens , its just the camera trick and the make up they are given , if we use it orginally will we get that change , no definetlty no For example take an product , namely toothpaste , the companies related to it are pepsodent , colgate , closeup , all this product have same ingredients and mixtures of same level , but while advertising each company showcases its own product , differently , comparing with others , not mentioning name of the differnt company , that their companies product has better features than others , u just tell me how the product desingned with same formula , but with companies different have different features . So the way advertisement is now used is just showcasing the product than it orginally be , makes product seem much better than it really is .  Another example is soap , the company JOCIL designes soaps , and they sell those to bonded companies , they just labels the paper on it and advertises about the product and simple express the features of it with out knowing it .  For advertising , now a days , the famous body is used , such as actor , sportsman , singer so on . .. so the people who liked the famous body , will automatically buy the product and others who doesnt like it , they dont go near the product , and this is one of the way that product is being showcased more than it is worthy of , as people like the words of famous bodies , they feel that the product is really worthy of being purchased , and they simply buy it as his/her famous body advertised the product .  Thus i feel that , the advertisement , is just showcasing the product than really the worthiness of it , make product seem much better than they really are . There is no doubt that certain qualities are there in the product , but all the qualities mentioned in advertisement , not neccessariliby in it , its just added qualities to attract the public to the product .

Some people argue as if it were a general truth that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than learning factors . But to be frank , I can not agree with them . There are numerous reasons why I hold no confidence on them , and I would explore a few primary ones here .  To begin with , we can lean the ideas and concept during studying factors . Teachers will be able to teach the student the ideas and concept by teaching a specific fact . Let 's take look at a physic class . At the very beginning , the teacher give the class a specific problem , and ask them to solve it . The student might not be able to solve it , so the teacher could tell the some conceptional suggestion that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think it again . And this time , the students might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept .  Further more , why do we learn the ideas and concept ? For practical work , of course . So , why do n't we learn something that is more practical ? Learning facts will lead us to work directly , and it would not waste a lot of time studying the boring theories or concepts , and this would save much more time .  Last but not least , studying facts will sometimes be more useful than studying concepts . For example , imagine we are learning how to repair the bike . From the books , we may just know how to solve the general problems . But when we face a special problem , an intergrating problem that noises from all over the bikes , for example , what could we do ? We might feel complicated to solve this kind of problem .  To sum up , learning facts can help us save a lot of time and because of the purpose of learning is for work , studyng fats might sometimes be more useful when we work than studying ideas and concepts . Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that it is advisable to learn facts rather than to understand the ideas and concepts .	CHI
In my definition the enjoyment of life is living life to its fullest . And thus , i believe that young people enjoy more life than older people . There are various points with me to discuss this issue .  Firstly , young people are mobile . In other words , they are young mind , young blood with dynamic energy . If some one is mobile he can reach any where to satisfy his need to live life and make it at its full wihtout any compromise . Whereas olders are at the age at which they have atleast one problem , which makes them immobile . At this age they are out of energy and liable to have atleast one health problem , makes them to stay at home and dependent .  secondly , young people are doing atleast one task like studying , job etc. and this makes them to come in touch with lots of people and new friends . This gives them the opportunity to makes new friends , with whom they can enjoy life by week ends , long drives etc. on ohter hand the olders are handicap in this regards . since they are compromised through health . which makes them to seat at home and alone with his health . So , no health , no going out , no friends and no enjoyments of life .  Moreover , In other words young people are twenty first century people . Young people utilizes all the latest technology by gaining its knowledge though the reliable sources , since they are intellignet enough to utilise it and convert it in to the new source on enjoyment of life . On other hand the older people still have the older mind setup which is out dated enough for the enjoyment of life .  In conclusion , the younger people do have the enough energy , chance to make friends and adequate knowledge to live life at its fullest , which olders lack in .	HIN
I strongly disagree with advertisement activities making products seems much better than they really do . This is a case of manepulating customers decision . Some times this concept might go further to demonstrate a staus of cheating when mentioning false information about products or giving unreliable guarantees . Companys and goods sellers should talk and descibe the actual advantages , features and services they have . Presenting these items to the customers in an attaractive way shall not be considered as a manner of cheating or telling lies . Ways of presenting goods and advertising to them in a proper and honest way is mentioning the components and items utelized to amnufacture these goods . Companys utelizing materials with quality might point out the how good are the materials used in manufacturing . Another way of fair advertising actitvities , is highlighting the efforts were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to tachieve this perfection . Marketing trends in some culture by attracting consumers with utelizing cultural concepts ( e.g. cultural and traditional saying as a logo ) . Another example of fair advertising is studying the trends and behaviours of consumers ( e.g. packing childrens ' toys in a bright colored boxes ) , and we shall not consider this a manner of manepulation whereas no false information were mentioned about this product . By observing international markets , manufatures and goods sellers all over the world are now trying to giving glorious and attractive names to their products which is n't a sort of decision makers manepulating . Focusing also on the customers needs and making pruchoures pointing out the positive side and promise of fulfilling their requirements can be considered a way fair promoting to some goods . I do beleive that all advertising activeties should be carefully studied to give bright image about any products to the customers without mentoining false information or making them look much better than they really are .

I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Eventhough organized tours are usually cheaper and more convenient , I think traveling by your own is a richer experience for several reasons .  The first reason of my belief is that organized tours bring you to the most touristic sites . These places are over-crowded by other tourists , and as a matter of fact , attracts also many local merchants that sell small commodities at expensive prices on all your way . For example , in my trip to China , the tour guide showed us a part of the Great Wall called `` Badaling '' . The place was full of people , I could hardly walk up the wall , it was very unpleasant ! On a second trip , I went myself to another point of the Great Wall , which was further to the city than Badaling , but there were much fewer people . Also , the scenery was much more spectacular .  The second reason why I hate organized trips is that you do n't have the choice of the timetable . Every visit is precisely scheduled and we should not stay overtime otherwise the bus or tour guide would leave you at the point it dropped you . A visit of the Louvre museum in Paris is not worth if you can only appreciate the `` Mona Lisa '' painting , and not contemplate the other , less famous , paintings .  Last but not least , I strongly believe that the most interesting part in travelling is when you make contact with the local people . In my trips to foreign countries , I learned a lot through the visit of the country , but I also learned many things about the culture through conversations with locals . It may be disgusting to see Chinese people splitting in the street . But once you understand that they do that to reject bad elements ( such as those coming from pollution ) instead of keeping them in their body , you may find it smart or at least understandable . Communicating with people , that is how you begin to respect their culture .  To conclude , as per my experience , I always recommend people to make a trip by their own and not with a guide . This is the best way to discover , understand and respect a culture .	FRE
When it come to traveling in a group some people may say that the best way to do so is led by a tour guide ; I personally disagree with that oppinion . It 's true that having a tour guide has its advantages such as being taken to all the typical local turist attractions , you will be almost sertain that you wo n't be missing out on any must see places . Yet , in the other had , having a tour guide limits your freetime . When traveling in a group you want to spend time with your friends , and spending it as you wish ; not having to be tied to a schedule as it is when using a tour guide . It could also be said that when traveling in big groups , people always want to see different things , and arguments may occur . Although having a tour guide could prevent this disagreements by simply following the itinerary set for that day , theres a better way to solve the problem . The group could just simply seperate , each person goes to where they want , and at the end of the day meet again . The advantage of this solution is that when a big number of people are together for a period of time , usually arguments happen ; by sending each person on their different way it gives them time to refresh from the enviroment of the group . Most important of all , of why is better to travel without a tour guide , it that having a tour guide babysitting you around the city take away a great part of the social and cultural interaction . The experience that you earn when you explore an unknown city on your own is something that can not be showed by a tour guide . In conclusion , for all the reasons named above , my suggestion when it comes to travaling in a group is to not hire a tour guide and explore the city on your own along with your friends .	SPA
According to many people , there will be fewer cars in use in the future than today . Environmental problems are linked with the huge number of cars in the world . Pollution has become a central problem in our societies . In order to respond to this problem , governements focus on many possible solutions such as limitation of cars in the cities . As an example , the mayor of London has introduced a congestion charge in the center of London in order to limit the number of cars . As far as I am concerned , I think that this solution is very convicing as it has been proved that the number of car has been reduced in the city .  Moreover , public transports are supported by many governements . The cost of undergroud is very cheap in some countries such as France . I would rather take the bus or the tube instead of driving my car . On the other hand , the cost of driving licences has considerely increased during the last years . As a result people are more likely to take the bus , or to use the underground than before .  However , emergent countries such as India or China are not ready to reduce there production of cars . Most of the economy is based on this production . Therefore , environmental issues are not the priority of governements . Although these countries are aware of cars ' pollution they do n't take preventive measures in order to solve this problem .  But many measures have been taken in order to face with this problem . The Kyoto 's Protocol illustrates the capacity to deal with the huge problem of pollution in the world . The problem is that many industrial countries did n't sign this protocol .  To conclude , I think that we can hope that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because governements make us aware that cars represents a huge scourge for our societies . As a consequence , many measures have been taken and will be taken in order to reduce car 's activity . However , even though many things have been done , the number of cars will increase because many poors countries need of this economy in order to survive .	FRE
I agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' In other words , successful people are never give up when they have bad situation and big problmes . They are try to sovle the problmes . Also they has lots of passion and encoourage . They are try to acheive thier goal and dream . They are always looking for new thing and they are never take a rest . They are always running for their goal . Successful people are different from the another people . Maybe , thier envriomnet is not good from another people and situtaion is not good . They have to spend time to achieve their goal . They have to read and read the book and have lots of knowledge . They can learn from another people 's experiences . Another people 's experience make them to try new thing beside the risk . Also another people 's experience give new oppunity try new things . It is not easy to try to new thing becuase they have to adopt the situtation and have to conquer the problems . Therefore , successful people never give up the dangerous situation and spend time to acheive the thier dream and goal .	KOR
When I read about successful people 's wrting about their lives , their success is always based on their very special new methods or inventions . Moreover , nowadays new challange is develop brand new ideas . Every human being always seek new ideas and new products to make them successful . Present world already has been developed too much for regular ideas or inventions . Moreover , people who succeeded always had hard times with them . In my opinion , because they faced with their problem and they overcome it , they can called successful people .  First of all , the successful people 's common stereotype is not satisfy to the present situation and always challange to the new one . Walt Disney did not satisfied with his current society 's broadcast . He invented variety Disney characters such as `` Mikky Mouse '' or `` Minni Mouse '' . This new characters contributed to obtain children 's attention , and it becomed the fuel for Walt Disney 's success . In addition he nevered stoped to create new characters , his unstoppable tring also make his success more shiny .  Second of all , the people who reach their success took lots of rick than ordinary people . It is not true that person can make their forturn in one try except the lottary . Successful people always took higher risk to obtain more new and valuable result from their try . When the Bill Gates was young man , he was attended to Harberd University and he was respected by others to just attend in the Harberd . However , when he tried to make the Microsoft programs , there are some episodes about he failed at his classes in university . Bill Gates gave up his reputations of Harverd . Normal people usually not doing it .  Third of all , Successful people did not stop to develope themselves . They always try new things with risk but never give up about it . They try and try untill they get satisfied data or result about it . Then they start to new try based on their collected informations . Piccaso is the famouse artist of the modern ages and his one painting values like more than million dollars . His work at that time was not that noticable because his painting was too creative . However , he did not give up drawing . He just kept draw and draw by his way . After he died , until now , we thought his painting is very creative and we gave him a creadit for it .  In short , Successful people try new things although they could take serious risks , and they never give up untill they reach their goal . Therefore , I strongly agree with the statement that is given .	KOR
Personally , I agree with the statement ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' . There will be many people disagreeing with this , but there are three major reason to convince . Those three are health , knowledge , and transportation .  First reason I think this way is because younger people have better health than older people . I was playing in the beach with my relatives . My cousins and I were running , splashing , swimming , and surfing . It was a lot fun for us , as everyone agree . Suddenly , My aunt called us to come out . It was big surprise for us . She called us because my grandfather has fainted . As a result , old people has bad health to enjoy their life .  Second one is that younger people has different knowledge than that of older people . Most of my age ( 14 ) people know a lot of entertaining place , and fun place . Eventually , olders ca n't go out broadly , because they do n't know many place to go . This was my friend 's grandparents story . It was hot sunny day , and they were retired from their work so they ahve a lot of time to go out . So , they wanted to go out some where , but they could n't . They phoned my friend , and asked her where to go , I was little bit surprised at first , but I understand that they had different lifestyle than us back where they were young like us .  Last reason that I agreed with the statement is because we have better transportation . Altough , grandparents have lots of time , some of them can not drive , because they had totally different lives compare to us . Nowadays , most of the university student can drive because it 's widely used , but old people did n't have chance to learn the driving . Also , younger ones can ride buses , subways , and skytrains . Unfortunantely , olders ca n't go by standing , they have to sit down some where , but sometimes public transportation does n't have enough spot for them to sit down .  In conclusion , youngs can enjoy life better than olders . It does n't mean that every elders all like these , but a lot of proportion of them are like this . I think enjoy life when we are young , and enjoy more quieter and relaxing life is better for elders .	KOR
Most people thing that is more to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because you can know more things of everything , I thing is more more important to know and specialiced in one specifict subject bescause , do you really get to know a specific thing , you get the oportunity to work in what you have learn and do it well .  Knowing a specific thing or subject do you really have the oportunity to became a profecional because you have the time to study a specific subject , because is what you really whant to learn more about and is what you like , if for an example a people whant to study many academic subject this persond have to study all the life to really get to know and learn many things .  Olso you get the oportunity to work in what you are really interest of and what you really like and whant to do the rest of you life , because if you like what you do and what you have learn you have the chace to be the best in what yo do , for example if you do something that you are not really interes in doing it and you just do it because you have to you could not doing that well and its going to be a waist of time .  In conclution i think that is more important that a persond specialize in what they really care about and what they really whant so in this way they can gift the best of their self and not to missed their time studyind things that are not really important or dont have interest for them , for me this would be a waist of timeand the life is to shot to waisted .

Over time , marketing and advertising strategies have being changed and improved in order to attract more and more the attention of the public . One way to this is creating advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are , which I trully believe for several reasons .  First of all , I had a personal experience where a I bought a lotion that promised to make a person loose certain amount of inches in the waist line . The actual advertisement showed the typical before and after picture . After using the product for a while , and even finishing it all , nothing happened . I did n't loose any inches , in fact . And these  Second , some companies make the product look better by simply omitting some information or having it appear on the advertisement in small letters . This information , is in some cases crucial such as side effects , contraindications , among other .  On the other hand , if companies advertisement strategies do not maximize the benefits of the products , wo n't be able to compete successfully with other products in the market and therefore wo n't be able to mantain a position the economy .  In conclusion , most companies nowadays have to make their products look really efficient , oherwise people wo n't buy what they do n't believe will work properly or wo n't meet their needs .	SPA
I do not agree with the statement , that there will be fewer cars in use then they are today in twenty years . The problem with cars is , that they need oil . Nowadays oil is very expensive . We also have to change something . New technologies are necessairy . A new generation of car technologie is a good start . It is called hybrid . This cars have two motors . One is the traditional otto-motor , the other one is an elctric one . This kind of cars are very economic . They run with oil when they are in a normal mode . In this mode they load up the batteries for the electric mode . After a short ride , especially fast rides ( they produce more energy ) , you can use the elctric motor . We have to support the technical research to improve inventions like this . In the future it will be more important to give money for research .  Another point that underlines the theorie , that there are countries in the world , that now begin to have cars . In China for example it was not common to have a car . But this countrie is so increasing , that in future they will have millions o	GER
In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . This is an interesting view of the future life .  Nowadays there are lots of cars . In every family with four people there are at least two cars . This is a big problem about pollution and environment . Cars are everywere , we do n't move without them and we do n't use very much pubblic transports like buses or trains . Generally people work in city where there are lots of pubblic trasports but they prefere to parking near the office or near the factory . It should be an idea to start to go by buses or by trains but there are other problems . If they want that more people catch trains , trains will must be always on time and cleaner .  On the other hand I do n't think that people will leave their car at home . Car is a status symbol . With a big car you can show to the other that you have a lot of money and a good job . In addiction technology involves and this will permit to eliminate petroil and to use other material . So pollution will be eliminate .  In conclusion I hope that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because I 'd prefer go by bicycle or by pubblic transports but I do n't think that this will be possible and maybe the ca use will be more than nowadays .

Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I disagree with this statement . When the first Nokia portable phone that was compatabile with a camera came out , advertisements all around showed that you could videotape scenes and take snapshots of friends . When people actually bought the product , what they actually saw was a reallity . Another example is when the iPod was released . Everyone was shocked about how a device smaller than a calculator could store more than a thousand songs . When people went and bought it , they saw how it could do it . It is not that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , it is about the person that buys the product . Many people when they see advertisments of new electronic devices , they get so happy to see something that new and something that functions in a new way so when they buy the product and use it everyday , they get bored of it . So when the person remembers how the product looked on billboards and newspapers and compares it with him after owning it for two months , he will think that the advertisement made the product seem much better than it really is . The reallity is that the person has been using the product effectivley that lead to him getting bored of it . My opinion is that most advertisments show what the real product is and that they do n't exaggerate on the product . Another problem is that many people understand the advertisment wrong . When the person goes to buy the product and the finds out that it does n't function the way he thought it is , the individual then gets unsatisfied . I think that people should understand the advertisment and what they are trying to say and understanding the message that they are trying to send .	ARA
It is often thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do , but is it really true ? A young person and an old person differ completely in terms of social status , experiences , physical abilities and other factors which can explain that statement . Let 's analyze them .  First of all , old people can sometimes be limited physically because of their age and it can prevent them from doing all they would like to do . Simple things of life can be difficult such as going shopping , driving , or maybe going out with friends . All this difficulties added together can make their life more difficult to enjoy .  Moreover , older people often have more responsibilities in terms of family or professional goals . This can create a lot of stress , psychological tensions which prevent people from enjoying life at its maximum . However , I have to say that having a family ( children . .. ) is not only a source of stress . .. and can therefore be a great cause of happiness !  On the contrary , young people are often more ` free ' psychologically as they are more unconscious than older people and want to experience life in a fun way and to enjoy it . They often do not have the preoccupations linked to a family or a professional situation . Consequently , they can be more selfish and have fun in life .  We also have to notice that young people often do not have the same problem of money than when they get older . Most of the time , the parents supply their chidren with money and all their material requirements . It is thus an important worry which dissapears and allows in one sense young people to enjoy life .  Finally , we arrive to the conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do because in a way , they are sometimes unconscious about some worries or problems which can exist in an older person 's life . However , some people prefer to make sacrifices during their youth and then enjoy life when they are older whereas other people make the opposite . .. But which is the best solution to enjoy life as much as you can ?	FRE
I disagree with the saying that understanding ideas and concepts is important for a student than it is to learn facts . ideas gives the student a invoke for what and how a task has to be done . concepts are studied from the earlier editions of books and from some written or , generally saying , from an abstract on wat is already done . concept also means basic idea of what is to be done . concept is the general background of any subject considered . ofcourse , without concept nothing is done properly , for example taking a major . A student does not catch up with the course if he has no idea about the concept or the basics of the course .  Facts is a very lively word to listen . fact explains which is true , true and only true . facts are the things to be considered in every particular task . According to me , learning facts always puts us in the place where we have to be . Learning facts sounds to something like behaviour , personal experience , something done . for example , giving a test wchich is relly new to a student . he has to give many practice tests in order to face the experience when on the real test . if the student just goes to the test with all ideas and fully known concept , it woud not be that good resulting as it would be when he takes practise test before .  Another example is putting up a new business.a man planning to start a new business , he has to learn the ideas , the concept of marketing , and as well the experiense . he has to observe some businessman , how they work with the daily shares . having an idea an the basic knowledge about the business does not just click into the market . there would be less profit in the work done without learning facts .  So , these observations conclude that half knowledge is always dangerous . thus , i disagree with the saying , more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

I agree with this statement . I think that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do for many reasons . The old people have to think some problems that the young people have not to think . For example , a old person has to think at his or her work and his or her family . When a person has got a family he or she has to think his children but the children has not to think anything because there are their parents that they think for them .  I am 23 years and I know the difference between I was 10 years and I am 23 years . Now , I have to think many things that I had not to think when I was 10 years . Now , I live alone and I have to do all the things that I did not do . For exampe , now I have to cooking because there is not anyhing to do that for me . In addition , I have to buy my food and wash my clothes .  In the other hand , when I was a young child I thounght to play with a friends of mine . I liked to play football and I played football with my friend for many hour each day . In addition , I went to swimming pool with my friends and I stayed there all the afternoon . In the swimming pool I played volleyball with a friends of mine and we were very happy .  Now , I can not do that I did when I was young because now , I have to go to work and I have not enough time to play football and to go to swimming pool .  At the end , I agree with the statement above because when I was young I enjoyed life more than I do now . I think that the young age is the most beautiful period of life that a person can live and I am sure that there are many other people that think this .	ITA
I agree with the statement which is successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . It depends on what the value of the successful is , so I take successful as become famous and change better world .  One of the example of successful company is McDonuld 's , the famous fast food chain in the United States . I just read the book about McDonuld 's . The founder of the McDonuld 's is McDonuld 's brother in the south of the United States . They were selling humbergers at the store which can buy foods getting on the car , drive-through . It was the major thinking of restrants at that time . But they changed the style . They changed all of the cycle to make humberger . It means that one person do only one job , like just bake the meat . Before that , there were one person did every steps to make humberger . This idea made more faster to serve food . Because of there effort , McDonuld 's became the biggest humberger company in the world .  Trying to do new things is always with some risks . It would be good if the new things brought success . But if the new things failed , it would be a nightmere . I think charenging new things is a kind of lottary . We can not know if the thing would be success .  Another good example of successful people is the person who maid the i-Pod . This product is the most hit products of Apple Company which used to produce Apple computer . The idea of making i-Pod as the lightest and having a big capacity of music is the fashionate idea . Apple Company is the first company to create products such as i-Pod . The attitude of challenging of new thing would make Apple to accomplish to be successful .  Because of these reasons , I agree with the idea of successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .	JPN

One might agree with that statement because on many situations it had happened to me that I had to learn all the facts for a test and I end up learning them all , but at the end of the test is like if everything wipped out of my head and that happens exactly the same with all of my classmates . But when we learn the concept of the fact instead of the fact it stays with you forever . Many times when I am in a conversation talking about history or chemistry I star talking about concepts that I have learned in a period of time and explaining my knowledge that I have obtained by me understanding the concepts .  This are the reasons for which I agree with this statement . Knowing the facts can work for a day or maybe a week , but the concepts stay with you forever .	SPA
My instant reaction on reading the statement was to get defensive and write about how there are several shining examples of youngsters helping their communities . However , I was forced to change my mind as the more I pondered over statement , the more I realised that it is sad , but true .  Young people are often so caught up in their own lives that it has become increasingly difficult to pull them away from their own agenda and try and get them interested in activities which they do not consider ` fun ' or ` cool ' .  This can be cleary seen even by the amount of time that young people spend with their own families . We find ourselves resorting to using fast but impersonal modes of communication like e-mail and instant messaging even with our parents and siblings . The amount of human interaction has surely decreased . So where 's the question of helping out one 's community ?  However , I think that the main problem is that most young people do not really know how to help their communities . They might also be hesitant as they feel they have nothing special which they can contribute to the community . Once this myth is dispelled , I think that more youngsters might find joy and pride in being part of something bigger than themselves , their community .  Young people , with their natural energy and enthusiasm can come up with bright and innovative ways of helping their community , This can be done in simple but useful ways , such as tutoring some of the younger kids in the neighbourhood , or making a little old lady 's day by visiting her in the old-aged home , or even going all out and organising an event for the whole community to take part in .  Therefore , while I do agree with the statement , I also have faith in younger people that they can and they will put their i-pods down for a while , and devote enough time to help their communities . Since no amount of compelling or nagging young people to help out will work , it would be more effective to teach by doing . I feel this can be achieved by getting the whole community involved in a project which everyone finds interesting and can take pride in .	TEL
Travelling in a group led by a tour guide presents many advantages . First , you can share and exchange your opinion and feelings on sites you visit with the groupmates . It is often very enjoyable and refreshing to listen to other people ' feedbacks .  Second , the tour guide takes you only to locations that matter the most or that are the most representative of the country visited . Therefore you avoid waste of time deciding where to go and whether the designated location worthes the visit . The guide is often a great source of important information about the visited site . He can turn the visit in a very interactive way , something you could n't get from a book .  Finally , the tour and the guide make the travel much more enjoyable as everything is already planned . There is no need then to bother with organization details and unexpected events . Everything is handled by the guide and the tour company .  However , travelling in a group and a tour guide may also have some disadvantages . In my eyes , being in a group means that you no longer master your time . Unless being selfish and imposing your ideas to others , you can not do what you want . You got to stay within the bounds and respect other peoples ' wishes . And listening to someone whining the whole day because the schedule does not please him is indeed extremely annoying .  Besides this , a tour means everything is already planned . There is therefore no room for sudden change of schedule or unexpected location to visit . The exitement might be undermined . If the tour company provides poor services or the guide lacks knowledge about the location , then your experience may turn out to be very disappointing and frustrating . Another very bad habbit of touring companies and guides is the fact that they often take you to locations , restaurants , museums with which they have a partnership , a deal , so you are invited to purchase items in those locations and not others . Personally I dislikes very much those practices as I have the feeling to be a kind of toy in their hands .  My best advice is to choose carefully the tour company . To rely on other people 's feedback , friends in order to determine which tour company suits the best our wishes and needs . About the group , my suggestion is to welcome things as they come and all the time to focus on what pleases you the most and to sweep away any little annoying detail .	FRE
I agree with the statement that successful people are tend to do the thing which is not familliar with them and get risks . I have several reasons for this .  First , to challenge new things makes people well-round . To take a personal example , when I was junior high school student , I hated to study liberal subjects , history , art , music . I had never been to musiums or concert halls . However , when I was university student , I changed my mind and tried to study liberal subjects . Thanks for the change , I became to well-round person who can talk any person . As above example illustrate , to try new thing makes peaple well-round .  Second , the people can find their best ways when they try new things . For instance , four years ago , I applied the new project in my company which I did not know how to do well . Althogh I had been sales person for five year , I tried the production field of computer company . I did well because I know what the client want to for our products . If I had not tried new fileld , I would not success for the job .  Therefore , I defenetly agree with the statement trying new things and taking risks rather than doing what people know well make peaple successful .	JPN
I do not think that in twenty years there will be less cars in use than today . It is no likely to happen because automobiles represent a huge engine for today 's economy and some people wo n't let their gold mine to be closed .  For example , lets think about the tire industry and the position of Goodyear or Pirelli about the decrease in the number of cars in the near future . I have no doubts they would use as many resources as they have to undermine every idea or project that could result in a contraction of their market .  Another example is the fuel industry , better said the business of Mobil , BP , Texaco and a few more brands . They have been investing billions of dollars trying to avoid the development of alternative sources of energy for automobiles . Their biggest business is to produce car 's fuel and they wo n't let it go so easily . If they are contrary to car transformations , logically they will fight fiercely against automobile diminishing .  Another example of how economic issues wo n't let the number of cars go smaller is the fact that public investment in the western countries consists mainly in road building . About 50 % of the public budgets all around the western countries are used to aloud car circulation . If the number of that kind of vehicles radically goes down , it will produce a huge administrative collapse since the traditional political economy would be mennaced .  In conclussion , neither the tire industry , nor the fuel producers or the public planners and administrators of the western countries will aloud the numbers of cars in use to decrease . In fact , I think in twenty years the economic pressure around the car related industries and economic fields will not only impede the decrease , but will boost the automobile use .	SPA
Micheal Jordan successed as an amazing NBA basketball player , just as much as Tom Cruise successed as one of the most popular actors in Hollywood . They both became to be well known people , however they are known for different reasons and talents . This shows that people are good at different things , and focusing on their best talent is the key to success . I disagree to the statement , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . Specializing in one scecific subject is a more definite way to succed , it lets you focus better , and it is less stressful .  One reason to support my opinion , is that specializing in one specific subject is a more definite way to succed in the future . I feel that having a more broad knowledge of many academic subjects , only helps you in your childhood . Trying to earn good grades in all of the classes you are taking , may be the pressure for thinking that it is better to have a broad knowledge . Having a broad knowledge may also set you off to find what you are good at . However , I believe that what is most important is what you become as , and working hard on what you are good at would actually get you somewhere in life .  Another reason why I feel that specializing in one subject in better than to have a broad knowledge of various subects , is so you could focus better . Trying hard ro on subject when you know you have to for another one , could be distracting . I feel that working hard for one subject would let you concentrate better .  Finally , I feel that it is less stressful to specialize in one subject . For example , I believe that it is difficult for someone to be good in both writing and mathematics . I believe that people usually do not like what they are not good at . If there are subjects that you would prefer not to take , because you know that you are not good at , you should rather work hard in a subject you know you like to do . My friend who is very talented in arts , is unfortunately not very talented in mathematics . So , what she does is that she does not take any mathema  In conclusion , I feel that specializing in one specific subject rather than having a broad knwledge of many academic subjects would lead you for a happier life .

For a long time ago , I visited Europe with my family in a group led by a tour guide . Although my family payed a great deal of money , we enjoyed the travel since the travel was convenient and helpful for increasing our knowledge . Like my case , people should notice that the best way to travel is in a groups led by the tour guide .  First of all , since the tour guide provides enough knowledge and information to people , it is the best way to travel in a group led by the tour guide . There are two purposes of travel . One is to have a rest and the other is to earn information related coutries or places that people travel . When people travel to acquire knowledge , they need professional guide as it is hard to get information about certain places by their own power . In contrast , when people travel without the tour guide , they will sightsee without getting information and this will not be beneficial for increasing their knowledge .  Safety of the tour guide also makes the tour guide more attractive . The foreign countries or places that people have not visited can be dangerous to people since they can not know factors that can be harmful . Therefore , people who travel alone sometimes get in troubles . For example , I heard news that one traveler who visited the foreign countries alone was kidnapped . Thus , to decrease the risk of travel , people should travel in a groups led by the tour guide that has been guided people for a long time and has bountiful knowledge about the dangerous factors , so the tour guide can make the travelers to travel safely .  Finally , the travelers do not need to concern about their travel plans , if they travel in a groups led by the tour guide . When people plan to travel alone . they have to consider various factors . They have to arrange hotels that they will stay and they have to purchase airplane tickets . Also , they have to plan their schedule and choose where to visit to see . However , people who travel in a group by the tour guide do not need to worry about these factors because tour guide companies plan everything . What the travelers have to do is just to pay money .  To sum up , the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by the tour guide because people can earn knowledge properly and travel safely . In addition , people do not have to endeavor to make plans .	KOR
As our topic is about The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i strongly agree with the note , as it has adavantages over the travelling with out a guide . first we discuss about the travel with out guide .  As everyone interested to go to new places as per their knowledge . they want to know the each and every thing present over there . before going everyone will do research about that , and information we got is very little when compare when we encountered it . sometimes it misses out good places sourrounded to that , no one is ready to explain the histroy of cultures and history of that place and also the how the importance came to that place , all these information is known to the people who staying overthere or people who visits often to the places .  Now come to the travel with guide , as they have very best of information . now i will give my personal experince so that it elevates the advantages of travel with guide , during my college days we went to the nothern part of the india , it included few places . when went to Tajmahal there we found very beautifull monument ever built , the guide explained the when it was built , who statrted this , and cultures followed that time , and some important things he told , after listening the lecture he made about Tajmahal , we came to know we had very little information about that . we very much excited about the information , we really felt like we are viewing that constuction and art . As we thought Tajmahal was the only place to visit , but the guide showed another beautiful monument just away from Tajmahal . we dont about that before , that was also a good piece too . After that we faced some problems regarding our trip , just lack of enough time , in that time our guide was so helpful , he planned accordingly out timings so that we not lost even single location . As the guide was a local guy he provided good food too . Throughout the journey we made with guide is very interesting and very helpful , after the tour we heard and learned good things like history information about the places etc .  Finally my conclusion was its not possible to know the things that really happened at the historical places , few things we can read or listen about those places but some we may not . so taking a guide is really helpful and informative . so that we can get more information than when we went to the travel without guide .

The contemporary youth is surrounded by very different challenges as well as distinctive opportunities to organize their lives . The competition at the job market , for instance , has become very hard and education is now considered to be of utmost importance for future prospects . This can lead to the fact that many youths have not the time to help their communities due to the time they spend studying for school or college .  Additionally , modern young people have many options to spend their leizure time . There are so many opportunities for youths to spend their free time , that they might forget to think about others . Media like the television , computer or the internet are just a few opportunities to spend free time . Due to this reason , the youths might be overstrained with the diversity of possibilites that surrounds them . Another factor which can keep young people from being concerned about their community can be that many of them are just to lazy to offer their help . The generation of so called `` couch potatoes '' illustrates this issue . Many young people are just hanging around either at home or anywhere else . The reason for this might be , on the one hand , that they lack the guidance of their parents which spend often the whole day working . On the other hand , the invention and improvement of computer games and other sources can be a reason why young people spend less time outside the four walls of their room .  In addition to this point , it seems also reasonable to me that life standard which has considerably been improved in the contemporary society has made students dull and even indifferent . Many young people just do not care if others need their help since they are satisfied with what they have and do not see any reason to think of others , especially their community .  With reference to these reasons I would agree with the statement that young people do not spend enough time helping their community in the contemporary society . The youth , in generall , has many interests that have nothing to do with their community , which can be the peer group , the media , the school and a huge amount of other issues . Additionally , they lack some guidance of their parents or other adults who could make the community more attractive to them .	GER
There are many ways to travel , such as travelling with our family , with our friends , as an individual or in a group led by a tour guide . Also the way we choose to travel is highly dependent on a place we choose to go . From my personal experiences , I think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way if we would like to go to a new place or city .  There are several reasons for this , first and maybe the most important one is that we might choose a country or a city that the local language is not our mother tongue , so the tour guide would be a helpful resource in this case and of course s/he would help us doing the procedures such as booking a hotel , knowing the restaurants , etc , while entering the place .  Also , as we are new in the city and we do not know many things about its social culture , by having a tour guide with us , we can easily be informed of the useful information about the habits and cultue of the people in that specific country , and we can be well prepared for the travel .  The second reason , in my opinion , is the fact that we surely would like to visit many new places in our travel and of course get many new information about the history , art , social life , music , etc of the place . How can we obtain such an information if we travel without a group led by a professional tour guide having lots of interesting information about the city ?  I think it might be possible to do all of these things if we travel individualy , but really we will waste lots of time on it . Third and last , To travel in a group is much more safer than the other ways , since there might be some possible dangers along out trip , the tour members can be helpful in these cases .  All in all , If I choose a new place to go , I prefer to travel in a group led by a skillful tour guide to have a great time and enjoy my trip .	TUR
With the rapid progress of time everything around us is changing rapidly . As the turn comes to people , they have changed in great aspects . In recent years , people is accustomed to be relax . Thus , they do not want to take risk . I strongly belive that successful people should take risk and try new things rather than only doing what they already know w to do well because they can get a better job and they have respectful situation in society .  To begin with one of the most important reasons of trying new things and taking risks is that people get a better job . It is obvious that if a person is successful , he/she struggles for gaining much money . Hence , he/she try to get new opportunities and he/she is ready to new conditions . For example , a man is a police and he does not complain abuot his job . However , a successful man wants to be a cheff and he struggles to get his goal . In addition to get better job , another crucial cause of trying new things and taking risks is having good situation in society . For instance , if a man try to be successful everybody around him respects him .  To sum up , i firmly belive that successful p	TUR
I personally agree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' not only beacause they are physically more fit to do so , but also because their outlook on life is full of illusions and great dreams .  Young people 's first advantage is thier physical condition due to their age . They have a vigorous body and therefore a vigorous mind . Mix these with a good moral education and a spirit for adventure and the result can be a young adult that truly and deeply enjoys his life .  On the other hand , older peple tend to be limited by their deteriorating body and have to deal with a limited diet and activitiy plan . They can have the moral base and the unbreakable spirit of a young person , but thier bodies will not keep up with these for a long time . It is obvious that the range of physical activities available to young people in life is much greater than that available to old people . Sky diving , snowbording , rock climbing are some examples of activites off-litimts to older persons .  The second advantage young peopel posess is their fresh outlook on life . This view of thier lives has not been tarnished by mistakes , torn relashionships , of failed attempts . Their emotions are strong and every new detail life brings to them is embraced with passion .  Older people tend to carry around old memories of lost loved ones , of failed attempts , torn relationships , mixed feelings , which in turn drane spiritual energy that would otherwise be used in more effective ways to enjoy life . A younger person has a better of acomplishing his life goals because he does n't waste valuable energy in regrets , or regrets .  In conclusion , young people have a better chance than oler people to enjoy life at its fullest , because of physical and emmotional advan	SPA
I agreeto the above statement because of the following reasons ,  Broad knowledge helps in knowing different things that we need to learn in our daily life . One should not get accustomed to one subject because if we are like that , we cant survive in this competitive world .  A human should have knowledge about each and every thing that is essential in his life , by learning every subject and obtaining the knowledge from various fields , a man can survive in any part of these world particularly in any field .  After having a very good knowledge in every fields , we can come to know the importance of various fields in our daily life which can be useful atleast once in our life .  We shouldhave a knowledge about various academic subjects like LITERATURE , ARTS , SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY , PHARMACY etc  just i mentioned a very few important subjects that had a vital role in our human life .  Any way after having a broad knowledge about the various subjects , we can achieve a very good knowledge which can improve the CREATIVITY and INDIVIDUALITY of the human .  We should learn various subjects for getting a grip all over the subjects that are neccesary for a man to survive and copeup with this competitive world . By learning and experiencing various things in our life , we can able to understandfor any kinds of situations that lead acoss our life , by this learning atleast we can develop HUMANITY towards other people and we can be kind to them .  By knowing various things and having knowledge at the same time man should not missuse this scientific knowledge by destroying country by discovring some nuclear bombs etc  We should use our great knowledge for developing the welfare of our country but not by destroying with a criminal mentality .  Therefore i agree to the above statement given , why because by having a broad knowledge about various subjects atleast we can know the minimum neccesities that are useful in our human life , bylearning about various subjects , later on we can do specialization only in one subject that we are interested and helps in developing our carrer in this busy life .  Now a days many of the engineering IT people people are settling in the software field for having an exposure to various fields .	TEL
In my opinion , young people actually enjoy life more than older people do . I hold this opinion because young people are less weak , less afraid , and less fragile than older people tend to be .  First of all , the majority of young people have alot of energy they can disperse without becoming tired easily . While most aged people get tired after just one activity , young people , like students , can do many activities in just one day . Even after long hours of work in school , they can easily take part in an afterschool activity , and then come home to do homework and chores . On the other hand , older people get tired quickly even after one activity , such as cleaning the house . Being able to do many activities in one day promotes the sense of accomplishment and happiness , and thus young people who have more energy enjoy life more than older people .  In addition , young people tend to be more brave than older people , and take more risks . Risks , because no outcome can be predicted , add excitement to the lives of young people . However , most older people prefer being stable and assured , and do not take risks . For example , alot of young people will travel to distant countries , and gain more experience . However older people prefer remaining where they are . Thus in the lives of older people things are monotonuous and predictable , whereas in the lives of young people , nothing can be predicted and everything is exciting .  Furthermore , young people are also more mentally capable than older people . As people grow old , they lose their ability to concentrate for long periods of time , or to learn new things . In contrast , young people are full of potential and can learn new things , like another language or a new recipe . Learning new things is very enjoyable , and younger people who have the advantage of better mental capabilities , enjoy life more than older people .  Older people are restrained by various factors , such as fragility and inability to continue activities for long period of time . However , because young people are stronger physically , mentally , and also have less fear , their lives are filled with excitement and fun , enabling them to enjoy life more than older people do .

I agree that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities . It is because that the technology now is much better than before , the young people now are too happy , and the effect of the media .  The technology today we have is way better than 10 or 15 years ago and young people have more entertainment in their life . The bad thing is that most of the young people spend most of their time to go along with these entertainment such as TV , Vadio games , MP3 , and computer . Compare to the older days , people would be more helpful in their communities since they did not have much entertainment . They would spend a whole afternoon in a community centre to help and learn . Young people would spend most of their time in front of a computer or a TV instead of helping their communities is because there are too many better things waiting for them .  Moreover , not caring other people is the point of view that the young people mostly having now . It is because they have not been in a hard time in their life since birth . They are too happy , and so they do not have an idea of helping others . The older people would spend time to help others because they know that even a little help would be a gift for some people . So , the young people would not spend a lot of time to help thier communities because they do not know that their help would be a great reward for some people .  Finally , the attudite of the young people is a problem as well . If the media encourage them , there would be a lot of helpers in the world . Media is the passway that the young people related the most , so if the media encourage the young people to spead time to help their communities and tell them that a lot of people would need help , they would spend more time to help .  Therefore , the improvment of technology , the way and attudite that the society is having now and the effect of the media are the most important things that make young people do not give enough time to help their communities .

I donot agree with the statement here which says that advertisements make the products seem much better than they are . I really feel it because a product owner knows that how the product is made and how it works so all the other matters he will be thinking on quality of product and how it will be reahed to people in correct way and thought . To make him this possible the only thing he haas in his hand is how to advertise it . So he feels a better way to advertise the product so that the product reaches the people and people come to know how worthy it is . Without advertising now a days it takes a long for a product to get settled in market and make its own stamp on that field to go into people .  The advertising may not be thought as a thing that to make people to totally beleive it but in advertisement and also on the product clearly producer says what it does and how it does , so based on requirements only the consumer buys the product but not the way it is advertised . Here we have to be careful that how it is advertised , to make an advertisement only the product must pass many tests that the product is introduced to market so by certifying only the product is released to market . So based on the requirements fulfilled by product only the advertisements are done . Not all the producers follow the same method but based on how much is the product costs the advertisements are done . The advertisements are done according to the taste of owner that how could it be advertised . Some use media as the advertising agent , some use marketers , some use paper phamplets to say there are many ways to advertise . Based on their taste and their capacity producer advertise their product .  The ways that the advertisements are very interesting in such a way that , by seeing them people would get of thought of buying them . Some of producer to get hold of the market and sales they would use celebrities , well known persons as their suit for advertisement by paying them a large amount of money . As advertisement is the only chance of making people know its a very important one . For example now governments are also depending on advertisement to make people know about things , projects are done . Here in my state a celebrity is the on for advertising about the polio programme done by government . So that people will know about it very quickly and correctly . So governments also rely on the advertising shows u how important the advertisements are .  To make the conclusion of the thing that advertisement is a best instrument and as fake advertisements are not done they make the product seem to be as it is but they donot make them feel better than they reaaly are .

Imagne one situation : you are sleeping well on your warm bed and you are dreaming kissing someone you admired , however all the romantic stopped by a sequence of loud knocking to tell you wake up and go for a trip . What is your response ? Terrible , please send to me the hell ! On my point of view , I think it is rediculous to travel in a group led by a tour guide .  The situation is one of the problems . I am a lazy guy and I really want to have appointment with my lover in my dream , however , you disturb it and ask me to go travelling ! The members of a group are divers , as a consequnce , it is hard to set a time good for everyone . When the tour guide waked the members up , perhraps some guys felt unwilling to get up to go . This will not only make the group tired and also make them unhappy .  The situation is not the only problems . If we are forming a group , that means we can not go separetly . We are just like small children following our teather ( tour guide ) to travel . It is inconvinent for the group members and may lose some beauty . Just think I found somewhere really beautiful but the tour guide said they are not in the plan ! How can I do ? Can I jump out of the group ? No .  Those two situation almost drive the group members crazy , but the worst is still to come ! The tour guide become the dominant of the group . How bad ? Bloody bad . Without that guy , we can do nothing but sleeping and waiting . That means if the tour guide want us to go some places that we do not intereting , we should go because our `` king '' ask us to go ! All of group members must listen to the tour guide or they will be cast away .  All the things happened on the way of the travelling is suffer for all of the group members . What I learn from the just referred situation that drive the poor group members crazy is that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .	CHI
It is a hot topic that successful people are love to try new things and take risks rather than keep to do what they already know how to do well . Manu different people hold the different opinions in the respective angles . In this topic , I need to say I agree that the success is belong to the people who like the new things and not afraid the risk . There are teo reason to support my idea .  First , I think the most important quality is finding . The people who like to contact new ways can always find the solution when they met the problems . In contrast , if you just rely on the tradition way to solve the problem , you are limiting your situation and may not overcome it . In other words , if you are not afraid the proble and face it , you can find it is not a proble for you easily . For example , when I was a child , I need to wait my mon to pick me up and back home after school . One day , my mon ca n't pick me because my grandmother was sick and she need to go to hosiptal . In that time , there is no mobile phone to be the conatct access . My mon was very nevous that she can not find me . In the mean time , I tried to find something to do and went to the library . In there , I met my brother who was studying and he take me back home finally .  Second , another quality is brave . People will sucess because not afraid to try any ways to complish their goal . In gernery , many ways means many chances . That is also measn you are increasing your chances when you are trying the new t  In conclusion , because of the above reasons , I strongly believed that people who like new things and advantures will be successful easier .

In an advertisement , `` Dior '' , everything looks like perfect and beautiful . However , the truth is , it 's the same as you thought when you buy the product . Like this , many products look better shown in the advertisement than in reality . So , i agree that most advertisement make products looke better than they are in real . The effect of this phenomenon is negative . The products are not that good such as shown in the advertisement . And also it sometime leads to a waste of money .  First , the product which you saw through TV or Internet and bought it because it seemed really good is not that good . For instance , one of my friend bought a mp-3 which was publicised on TV . On the advertisement the mp-3 looked cool and its sound system sounded very good . But when he got it , the product 's shape was not that cool as shown on TV . And also the sound system was n't really good at all . So , he really regreted the fact that he bought it .  Secondly , since you buy the products which looked good on TV without checking the information of it , it 's a waste of money . Often , when you turn the TV on , a lot of advertisement about movies are advertised . And it makes the movie really good . So , when you go to see that movie , you might be disappointed . One day , I saw ` National Treasure '' advertised on TV which looked really exciting . So , I went to see that movie with my friends and watched it . It was really boring and I even slept for a moment . The advertisement looked exciting with action it got , but in the real movie , there were few actions and the story was inaceptable for me .  I think not all advertisements make the products look better than it is in real , but most of them do . And I think that advertisements should make the products look as it is in reality .	KOR
Petrol is the main source of energy used nowadays but the problem is that scientist 's researches says that there is n't alot of petrol still stored in the earth 's crust . Most of the petrol which was underground was dug up .  People nowadays use a lot of petrol for their cars and they do n't think about the future . They dont think what will happen when the petrol runs out ! . The petrol dugged from the earth 's crust is decreasing every day very rapidly due to the huge number of cars present on earth and the factories using petrol as a source of energy . As the petrol present decrease its price will increase a lot ! . Sometime in the near future the price of petrol will be very high that alot of people ca n't afford it , so people will have cars but they ca n't afford the petrol !! IRONIC is n't it ? ! .  On the other hand , a lot of scientists are now devoting themselves to stop this crisis before it happens . so they are researching different sources for energy like solar energy and electric energy . there are other sources of energy that are being researched but electric and solar energy are the ones being focused on but the problem is that both this energy sources are not dependable . First , the sun gives out vast amount of energy but the problem is it is not available all day long . it is not available at night . Second , electric energy is a good source of energy but the problem is nowadays electric energy is conducted by conducters which work on petrol so that brings us to the first problem !! .  There is no definite solutions to the problem of petrol being finished , the only thing people can do is that they try to decrease the use of petrol now to try and stall this crisis from happening . So in my opinion in twenty years definitly there will be fewer cars in use than there is today .	ARA
Personally speaking , I do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led bt a guide .  Firstly , travel is a course for relax and feedom for sight seeing . If we do everything in the trips follows by someone , it just look like working as usual . when I take a trips by myself or with my friends , we could go everywhere we want , we could eat everything we like . We talk and laught loudly , and we enjoy myself .  Secondly , in the jounry , the time we spend in the place we loved is depend on how much we like . If we find some place beautiful , we can have a good time there for long . Once we feel tired during some part in a trip , we can stop and have a rest , we can have a drink in the cafe in the way , too . No one could stop you .  Thirdly , it is said that the tour guide may shows you manythings so you would learn more in the trip , however , in my opinion , it is not neccssary for me to know much by hear the guide said , also , it makes me tired , during the holiday , we should enjoy and learn things by tring and seeing by outrselves . We will find more while we take a try in everthing .  The best way to travel is to travel yourself or with your few good friends . It will give you a hard forgetable time , and your frinendship would be deeper . I am not here tosays the other choice is bad , but I think , not as good as mine , you know , travel in group may make you tired . . So , I do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , enjioy yourself in the travel .	CHI
Over the last century , advertising has become one of the most developped and i ; portant activity in humankind . It suurounds us everywhere today : on television of course , in the street , in the subway , on our cars . .. we can not avoid it . Some may say that : `` Most advertisers make products seem much better than they really are '' . Do they ? Is advertising that simple ? Do they not take into account the risk it creates when the customer will be disappointed ?  First of all , the question seems simple , of course they do , they sure will not make their products seem worse . They are paid to sell something to people who did not even want to buy it in the first place , who did not even needed it sometimes . They must create a need in customers ' minds and a will to buy precisely that product . How could they do that without making their products look good , even better than they are , to kind of sell dream to people . It is not what they do it for but in the end they kind of give hope to people , like when one sees an advertisment who would make one believe that the product it defends is exactly what one has hoped to find during all these years , or tht it is so much better that all its competition . That is why in all soap spots , the laundry is whiter and smoother than ever or in all shampoo spots , the actress ' hair shines more than ever .  However , is it always like that ? Do not advertisers fear people to stop buying a product because they were deceived by the difference with the ad ? Actually , even if it is not to be more honest with people , some advertisers use other techniques to sell their products . They can choose to criticize their competition in order to make their product look better by comparison . It is what is importat in the end that the buyer choosse your product over the others . It was used by Coca Cola in a spot in which a little girl shows her deceivement with thw voice of a Godfather when she is given a Pepsi Cola and not the Coca Cola she ordered . Advertising could also use reversed psychology , maybe to play with people curiosity , like the campaign using do not go and see that movie , it is bad for instance .  To conclude , I would say that whereas other techniques exist , most advertisers make products seem better than they really are . Nowadays , eventhough people know all they see in advertising is not true , they fall for it anyway and that is how tha consumption society got this far .	FRE
I totally agree with that statementa that young people recently do not have enough time to help their communities . There are several reasons why I think so : rack of time and busy life , and unfamiliarity with the community .  First of all , I am also one of the young people who do not engage in helping their comunities . In my opinion , the big reason is that they are just too busy jsut to go to school . In my case , even I want to give my time to help my communities , I do not have enough time t spend in it because of the school . Recently , many students go private school far from the house not public school located close to the house . I also go to private school . The school is so far that it takes me one and a half hours to get there . Threfore , it is difficult to find and spare the time to contribute to my community because of lack of the time .  Second , most students even elementry school students go to juku school after school because amny parents and students are not satisfied with the education of the school or they think they need support school study . Therefore , they do not have time even to have familty time or to hang out with friends . Students of the age that are the time to take entrance examination to next school such as high school or university go juku almost whole week . Consequently , they would rather to have time to spend with family or friends if they could find the time .  Third , they and I feel the community is not familiar with us . I am sure all people knew each faces of their all neighbors and they communicateed each other a lot long time ago , To my disppointment , it does not happen now . I just moved new city so I do not know about my community and my neighbor . As a result , even there is a festival , I always do not participate in it because there is no people who I know . I guess it occur to people nowadays a lot .  In conclusion , I am in agreement that most young people do not spare enough time to support their communities . Even they want to help them , it is not easy because recent childrent are having busy day . I think we need to find the way to community to be more active at first .	JPN
Young people now-a-days do not give enough time to helping their communities . I agree with the above statement that young people do not give enough time to help their communities . There are many reasons to support this .  Firstly , in this competetive world young people are much concerned with their carreer , goals and their aims so , they are more involved in their studies . As a purpose they go to college regularly and study their day to day lessons regularly . The subject has become so vast that they have to refer many books and it takes much time for them . So , they do not have much time on other activities such as , helping their communities .  Secondly , the people now a days show much interest in enjoying themselves with their friends . They either go to movie or restaurants or pubs or to the play grounds with their friends . They are always in a mood to enjoy themselves . They do not help the communities because they do not spare their time to work on good things and helping their communities .  Thirdly , the people these days became very selfish and they do their own work which is helpful to that particular individual . They does not want to help his communities which is beneficial to all . That is why he concentrates mainly on his work rather than helping the community .  Finally , now-a-days people are more attracted to media such as television , newspapers , magazines , weeklys etc . , . People are more concentrating on these knowing about the world through news papers and news on televisions and other means . There is also a rapid growth of importance for computers and internet and it draws the attention of young people towards it . Young people are much attracted to find the new things and they browse the internet spending most of their time finding out the information that is useful to them .  Due to these above stated reasons , now - a-days people , mainly youngsters do not spend enough time to help their communities .	TEL
Being asked , the question , whether there would be less cars in twenty years in use than today , my answer would be a strong `` no '' .  Firstly a raise in population and wealth can be seen all over the planet . More and more people from the Asian countries are able to buy a car and they do so . And this is just today . Probably in twenty years peole from Africa will be also able to buy cars , so a greater need will be there on the market .  Secondly the automotive industry develops new cars each year . This tendency to create nicer and fancier models from year to year probably will contiune . Public resonds exited to it . Just have a look at the crowded exhibitions like IAA or Genfer Salon . People from all classes come there to watch the cars and they are fascinated . So in spite of not having enough money to buy a certain car , people tend to do so anyway . This is shown in statistics of car dealers , which show , that more and more cars are not paid when bought , but on a monthly base afterwards .  There might be some critical voices , stating , that there will be some laws in future days , to cut the use of cars extremly in order to protect the environment . Being an engineer in the automotive industry I do not believe that might occur . Teams of experts spend hours day by day to improve the cars , to make them more effective and to reduce the amount of poisson , that comes out of the exhaust . For being prepared for the days , when oil will become a rare good , the engineers already today think about methods of building new engines , that work without oil .  So to summarize my statements it can not be said , that there will be less cars in twenty years than today . For reasons such as general welth developement , no political restricions due to better technics and mainly because people will be just as fascinated as today by the new cars , developed from the automotive industry .

I disagree with this statement . There are three reasons .  First , anybody can enjoy its life whether he/she is young or old . That 's the matter of feeling or thinking of individuals , not age . You can see it from the statistics about the age of suicide people . The number of older is n't different much as younger people 's . They die because of dissapointment to their life . I think that may be one of the proof of young people does n't enjoy life .  Second , that olders who usually move and speak slowly may give an impression to people to think they are boring or have nothing to do . It is not true . Thanks to their experiences and knowldges come from their long life , they know how to enjoy and have fun in their way in any situation . Older  Third , the number of older people who goes to educational facility , like city college , is still increasing . That means they have passion to get higher education and enthusiasm to earn new knowledge .  Compared to older people , younger seems spend much	JPN
`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''  I agree with the above statement that successful people should try and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . A person must first secure his position both financially and mentally by doing what he is skilled in . Then there is no point in doing the same thing again and again and produce the same results . For a person to grow in life , he must try innovative means to do the same work or try new things and take risks .  As we know , doing the same work repeatedly will add nothing but boredom to one 's life . To add spice to life , one must try something new . But this should be done carefully and responsibly so that it does not affect one 's existing reputation and profession . Let us consider one of the giants in global economy , Mr.Dhirubhai Ambani who was the founder and Director of Reliance Industrial group in India . He initially entered the market in the final quarter of the 20th century by starting a textile firm which he struggled very hard to develop into a very big company . He was very successful and was financially very secure at that time . Yet , he was a true entrepreneur and tried out innovative things and took many risks by entering petroleum industry . Now Reliance petroleum is a very big name in Indian economy .  In addition to the above mentioned industries , he also started Reliance telecommunications which is the first CDMA mobile service in India . He reaped huge profits through this . Infact , Reliance group has entered Energy and Retail sectors also . Today , Reliance Group stands among the top 50 companies globally . All this would not have been possible if he had not taken the risks and entered into these businesses instead of holding on to the textile business .  So I think it is always better to secure your position first both financially and mentally and then try out innovative things and take risks to develop your business . A successful man does n't rest at any point of time but strives hard to be more successful . Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .

The idea that students should learn ideas and concepts rather than facts neither looks logic nor rational . I would completely disagree with that idea for a lot of reasons . I do think that in order for young growing people to learn facts of life and science in different specialities in order to be able to have the ideas of their own , otherwise they will just come with mixed out ideas and concepts . So it is sort of chronological process .  I do not think for example how would a student could come up with certain invention or innovation in certain machine or subject without clearly taking in all the basic facts of how this machine is working and the basic scientic factors contolling its function or he may end up with catastrophy .  Another reason , is that study of facts broadens the horizon of the student vision , then he would be quite capable of finding out the concepts and basic ideas by himself , by studying how every thing in life would correctly work . It is only after passing that stage of basic learnig that his ability to investigate and relate new concepts and theories .  Young students tend to be arrogant if they believe that they know concepts and ideas , that would be useful only after ensuring they really learn the facts and be able use them in the proper context .  And last but not least , education is an active process , and unless the students forced from their younghood to learn hard and given facts and certain assignments they would be reluctant to offer any thing useful to the world or be aids in world 's progress .  It is that young age that students could be taught all the human sciences and knowlege and if we start by the idea of coming off teaching them the facts and basic sciences we will end up with ignorant generation .  In conclusion , i belief students should be taught facts and basics of sciences rather than merely giving them ideas and concepts as it would not help them enough to proceed in their careers .	ARA
The acadimic knowledge is the information gained starting from the elementry school , ending with the higher level of the university . There are two way 's would face the student who wants to prsue his graduate studies after finishing his bachelor degree in any major . The first one is to complete what he have started and in the same major , like what they are saing , `` Its good to know a thing about every thing , and to know every thing about one thing '' . Or in the other way of the road is to chang his major and go to an other subject .  Some Graduate programs is designed for those who want to mix there knowledge and try to open a new doors in there life . For example , some paple , who have an engineering bakeground , is going to the buesniss school , to compaine their basic knowledge , in problem solving , with the way of applying this knowledge in the buesniss .  There are alot of amazing stories about people found that its a good way to explore the world of knowldge in several ways and to see that world through more than one point of view .	ARA
I agree with this is the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide . If u will go to the visit the one country without guide . If you know little bit about the visit place you can manage what ever you know about the country . you want visit more places in that country u dont know about the visit place then you need guide . There is no guide along with you whatever u know you can visit the place . If there are more visiting place are there you can not visit that place . At the same time you can face languge problem . If you visit the place simply by saw the place it is waste If the guide is along with you he can explains if there is a histerical places are present . If you know about visiting places completely u dont need a guide .  In some case If you want to visit the new place uyou want know the language of that visiting place . At the some times food at thevisiting place is not good .  If you take the guide along with he is familier with that place this can be helpful to us . Guide known the languge so that there is no communication problem . next some visit place food is not good . So guide know the where the food available fresh food .

Another one is he well known about the which hotels is good and which hotel is available at our allowabel financial .  it wiil beeter to go with guide whenever you t	TEL
Some people try to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , while others wish to specialize in one specific subject . I believe it is more preferable to first have vast knowledge .  First , knowledge is good for my children . If I have more knowledge , I will be able to educate my children better . My father used to teach me things that I did not learn at school . For example , my school did not teach why water is formed around a glass of cold water . I was always curious about it , and it was my fater who told me the answer . As my father taught me , I want to do the same thing to my children .  In addition , the chances of getting a job increase . Let 's say that I took geometry , biology , and psychology in college . Although I did not specialize in one subject , I still have a lot of information in each subject . I can be a math teacher , a worker in biological museum , or a guidance counselor at middle school . What will happen if I specialized only in geometry ? Once I can not be a geometry teacher , I will have nothing to do , but just wait .  Finally , I can pick a subject and specialize in it later . I will experience and evaluate the subjects while I learn many subjects . After the education , I will have a pretty good idea which subjects fit my interests . Using the same example as before , let 's assume that I became very interested in biology . People say there is no end to learning ; I will not hesitate to take biology again and go deeper into it .  In conclusion , I think learning a variety of subjects is important , because it allows me to teach my children , get a job , and specialize in subject that is suitable for me .	KOR
When I was 16 years old I traveled with my mother all around Europe . She paid to a travel agency to have a guide in our trip . That adventure was amazing ! if I would have the chance to experiment the same situation , I would not have second thoghts about paying a tour guide again . So I am completely agree with the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .  First of all , I am agree with paying someone to show me around because it is the best way to visit everything in a city , in which I do not know anything about it . Furthermore , this guide can show me the history , the monuments , the anegdotes , traditional restaurants and places to party , and all of these for the same price ! For instance , in the trip that I mencionated at the begining , the one that I did with my mother , this guide showed us every single place of France ; actually my mother went by her self three years before we did and thank this guide she learnt new more things about Paris .  Second of all , If I travel with a guide tour I am going to be save because this person supposes to know the right ways at the best times to visit the city so I do not have to worry about which rout should I take to not surprise my self with any problem .  To summarize I prefer to travel with a tour guide because I think that it is the best way to learn things about a new place . In addition , a person is better than a book , because any question you have she or he can answer it at the moment and also the personal experiences of a tour guide are more interesting that the onces that you can find in a book .

Yes , i do agree with the topic that young people enjoy life more than the older people . This topic is very interesting one because many people maynot agree with my view . Life is not as it was some years ago , it has become very fast paced . Due to this even the stress levels have increased , so it is difficult for the older ones to survive . The older people are not able to compete with their younger rivals . This means they are not able to enjoy their work or the sucess it brings . so it would be fair to say the young are able to enjoy life more . Sometime back I read in a novel that Alexander could pursue his plans vigourously only due to his youth . From history , we do know that the great emperor Trajan lamented that he could do nomore conquests due his old age . So this shows that in order to do most of the things in life we need youth . So to even enjoy life and it 's pleasures we need youth . We have read in numerous stories that men have been searching for the elixir of youth to stay young forever . Even many of the modern day research are going on to slow the ageing process and it 's effects , billions of dollars are being spent on it . To do many adventures in life also we need youth . Youth is a divine gift which must not be wasted because you ca n't get it back . So we must finish important things in life when we have youth else we are too late . So this is my personal opinion . I am not saying that oldage is a curse or anything rather that youth is a blessing , so we have to use to the maximum i.e , enjoy life when we have the youth so we wo n't regret in our oldage .	TEL
Nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping communities .  I desagree about that . There are many reasons why i desagree . First , it shoul n't say a generality . There are lot of young people who help our communities . For example , when Katrina destroyed Louisina and Alabama , young peolpe helped this citys , they had organized a basketball game of charity , with the NBA players .  An other example , young people help old person and give enough time instead of to play football or go to the shopping . Nowadays , young people give enough time for their communities , they organiz party for the children , take time in the hospital to give their help . They create association to beat the A.I.S.D , poverty and the childrens in the hospital who had not money .  Often youngs stars back to do a show for bring money for asscociation and for to build house , park , stadium .  Finally i think young people work enough for thier cmmu	FRE
I do n't really agree with the statement which says that learning ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts , because I believe both of them are important skills students need to learn to possess during their learning periods , and they both are crucial for those who wish to become a person who can think critically and creatively .  First , I believe that learning ideas and concepts from previous scholars and great thinkers is important for students who have n't possess a fixed thinking style yet . Since they are still young and changeable , they can learn things from others ' ideas and beliefs and find out what kind of ideas they would prefer more in and try to adopt those ideas in their own daily experince . For example , a student can try to examine whether the idea that cooperating with others is always better than working on one 's own is true or not , while he or she uses different techniques working on a preject . If this student finds out that working together is more efficient , he or she might want to try this method again in the future .  Secondly , I think that there are a lot of different angles we can look at one thing or even an objects , which means that there are a lot of aspects for us to examine a fact when using different ideas and concepts . When students learn a fact , they can try to use their previosly-learned different ideas and concepts to look at it . After examining things from numorous aspects , through different ideas and concepts , students will start to understand the diversity of every single fact , and eventually , learn to think critically and flexibly . For eample , s tudent might find out that working with others is sometimes more efficient , but there are also a lot of risks he or she might encounter .  Finally , it is always important for everyone of us to have our own set of ideas and concepts towards this great universe ; we need to try to come up with our own thinking system and develop our unique ways to examine different facts . We learn from others ' ideas and concepts ; we examine these through our daily experience ; we match them with facts to see if they are correct ; and finally , we will develop our own way of thinking . There are the reasons which make me believe that both learning ideas and facts	CHI
I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to merely learn facts , hence forth agreeing to the statement . One of the best examples to support this statement goes back in time before the renassance period in Europe . The roman catholic church at that time was the ruling authority . They proposed false facts that the earth was the centre of the solar system and that all the other planets revolved around it . This was tought to the masses and then at that time preference was given to the facts even if they were untrue regardless of the underlyng concepts on how a solar system worked . So even if the fact didnt have any underlying idea to it or concept , it was given importance , thus the result that people living under a lie .  Now if the idea that understanding and conceptualizing was more importand than just learning mere facts was presented at that time , there would have been a great advancement in the knowledge of the universe even before the renesance priod .  The statement also supports one of the idomoms that `` necessity is the mother of invention '' . If the students are exposed to only facts , which are a kind of invention by others who understood ideas before , there would not be any room for free thinking and the resultant , which in this case is the future ( Students are the future ) would be stagnated !  Also I believe that some facts can be altered and/or proved wrong by understanding ideas and concepts . Again the example stated above serves for this statement . At the renessance period the false facts were proved wrong by free thinkers like Galleleo with the help of their ability to understand ideas and concepts . Great discoveries and inventions were made at that perioid and many new facts were made .  Thus all and all we can consider that one needs to develop ideas and concepts IN ORDER to make facts in the first place and that facts are just resultant part of it .	HIN
In our world which is surrounded by the technology and it 's equipments people start to  With the tecnology and it 's affects to the daily life ; everybody started to meet new things which make their life easier than before . For example ; wash machine ; dish machine ; frigator ; television and as a last step of today there are cellphone ; computer ; internet etc . All of them which I mentioned are making easier our lives and I am sure there will be invented more things later .  Before these inventions there was cooperation in every area ; women were doing the washing duty together near the river ; they bake a bread together too or farmers were helped by others to clean the farm . From the time the technology interfere their life ; people started to do this activities at home . This lead people to be a little bit alone . Maybe this can be defined as good but I personally define it as ` bad` .  On the other hand ; what I can define as ` good ' is ; helping people is more easier now . For example if you want to make a donation you do not need to go to the charity or the bank ; you just open the internet ; type the address and give the credit card number . it is so easy .  Finally because of these reasons I strongly believe that young people are giving enough time to helping the community .	TUR
Travilling is sometimes for holiday and seeing new places but sometimes it is for job . For the first , you can travel yourself or travel with a group led by a tour guide . Sometimes you need the first one , sometimes the second one . I disagree the statement ; The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . It change according to the your physchology or your destination , that can be abroad or inside of your conutry . I prefer travel my own becuse of several reasons .  Firstly , when you travel with a group led by tour guide you must fallow them all your travel . It sounds do not come me good . It seems very resricted and boring . Before you travel to some places sometimes you make some search about this place anda you imagine something also you plan something . When you travel with a group if a tour guide will plan to see places , where you plan to see , it is a problem . Addtion to this , you can be bored the place but because of the group you must be in there . So it is not a good situtaion .  Secondly , tour guides generally take you historical places . Sometimes it is a good but for person who is not interested with history or art it is also bad situtaion .  In conclusion there are many reason like these to prefer travel my own . Tour may not be good as you espected . The hotel may not be clear or comfortable . Altough there are some advantages of travalling with a group led by a tour guide ,	TUR
I agree with the statement that the young people nowaday do not give enough time to helping their communities . They spend too much time in studing their class , waste much of their time in personal enjoyment , and do not understand the real meaning of helping their communities .  As a fact , the parents in Taiwan always want their children to have good academic achievement more than the other things . They want their young people to study again and again , and do not expect them to pay any attention and spend much time to the other things except reading and studing . As a result , the young people will not spend much time to the other things such as helping their communities .  The young people are still like children , so they prefer to play such as spend their time to play computer games or watch TV in an air-conditioned room in their vacation or off-school time rather than to help their communities outside the door , espcially in a hot summer weather in Taiwan .  For example , my nephew is a teenager , but he did not know any things about the communities where he lived for more than ten years . He prefer to talk to his friends by cellar phone , and have a date with his girl fiend . He spend his time to help his communities only when his high school ask him to hand out the report about his service in his community and the report will be graded . Except this . when I suggested that he may have a community service in our communities , he was surprised that I have such a strange idea that he never have .  In conclusion , it becomes a common social phenomenon that the young people do not give enough time to help their communities because their parents and the whole community did not facilitate them to help their communities and give a good reward and help them to understand the real meaning of helping their communities . As such , the young people are loosing their recognition of their own communities .	CHI
Yes , i totally agree with this term of travelling in a group led by a tour guide . It is mainly because as we are a tourist so we dont know much about the places in a particular place . We will visit only those places which are known to us . But if you travel in a gruoup led by a tour guide you will be able to see more new places that u have neevr imagined to see in that particular place .  The tour guide plays a very important role in making our tour very intresting and adventurous . He tells us about the stories of the different places of that place and make us feel more and more excited to visit that place .  I visited Agra ( India ) . I was traveling with my friends and we all planned to hire for a tour that is led by a guide so that we can visit more and more places and can come to know about the history of those places . As i know , Agra is a city of history . It have lots of history in it and i wanted to know the proper history of that place . I was sure that only a group tour guide can only tell us about it and i was not wrong at all . He told the whole group about the history of all those historical places in that town . As we know one of the Seven Wonders ` Taj Mahal ' is also located in that city . I was touched by listning the history of that Wonder . Not only me but the whole group was touched by what all he told us about it .  I think i was not in that group with that guide i would have never enjoyed my trip to Agra . As i would not have come to know all wat he told to the whole group . The history of great Taj Mahal .  Since then i love to travel in a group which is led by a tour guide . Actually what i think one should must visit new places in a group led by a tour guide . Im saying so mainly because you come to know about the places of that town and everything about that town . If you like it then you can come again on your own without a torurist guide . But if you are visitng a new place for the first time then you have to travel in a group which is lead by a tour guide . If you have a tour guide then you need not have to take ant tension for accomodation traveeling from one place to another . All these tasks are done by a tour guide only . We dont even have to buy tickets again and again . In all when we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide we are in a full mood of enjoying . No work tension nothing . Only enjoyment and enjoyment .  So i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .	HIN
Young people definitely contain the advantage of a fresh thought and innovative independent spirit , differently from the elderly that has often experienced much of the world 's phenomenological offerings and seems to approach situations with more tranquility and serenity . However , this proneness of both groups of people to behave in a certain manner does not determine the exact outcome of the indiviual development of personality , which is a key factor that truly determines how effectively a person chooses to enjoy the beauties of his or her existence . Hence , when we speak of a vast majority one should definitely considerate the fact that younglings are more open to challenge and extasis than senior citizens who seek a calm state of being , which to the eyes of society is less likely to express the true enjoyment of life .  Young people have the strenght and availabity to discover new grounds ; it is part of our nature that whenever we discover and explore , sentiments of joy fill our souls . That is what young people take advantage of , this is , their physical condition and psychological standpoint that drives them to seek gratifying experiences more often than elders do , and finally accomplishing such goal .  My grandfather used to play soccer when he was young and that was his favorite sport . He received so much joy and gratification from this activity that he would never miss a game . Now , he is 70 years old and all he wants to do is rest . He used to tell me : `` Soccer is it son , once it 's gone , you only live from your memories '' . Now I am a soccer player and this sport has become part of who I am , like a blueprint . My life would not be the same if I do not play , due to the fact that I find so much joy and happiness in it .  Thus , I believe young people do enjoy life in a more complete manner , not to be unjust or parcial , but because it goes beyond what is palpable , it is a cycle , the cycle of life . Just like a flower reaches its most beautiful point and opens up in all its splendor and after a certain time dries up and dies , similarly is a man who lives and finishes his race . Even though older people might find joy in different tasks , their cycle alrady allowed them to reach a certain climax that was once considered as true enjoyment , therefore leading the way for those behind them to discover and get to search for the same type of gratification , making the levels of joy definitely higher at a young age .

I think it is very much essential for a student to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts . These days the technology has developed , new things are been invented this is only because of the main reason that is logical thinking about some thing . The invention of the telephone does not made Graham Bell ( who invented telephone ) to refering for the facts . Instead , he thought it logically and implemented physical experiments by using concepts . As we look at many of the scientists of the early ages they donot think much about the facts , rather they understood the ideas about how to implement it .  So it is better for a student to study different concepts and implement his ideas . Let us consider another example . If the students do think only about the facts they only bother about few things like only Oil , petrol , kerosine and white petrole are the combustion fuels , and automotives can not run without petrol or diesel . If that is the case , Sastry who was a student would not have discovered the fuel for the automobies . He extracted some solution by using a plant 's leaf and mixed that with some chemicals and finally used as a fuel for automobiles . this is mainly depends on lot of understanding about the concept and keeping a hard effort to implement his ideas . This idea would be great benificial for the society .  And coming to the secondary of the topic which deals with the learning of facts . It is useful to some extent for the students . This is because when we deal about the solar system , and a student is being asked about what is the shape of the earth , or how many planets are there in the solar system ? Then the student may refer to the facts rather than experimenting on that .	TEL
It is debatable whether traveling alone is the best way to travel that by a tour guide . Some people might recommend to travel alone a least once in order to have alone time to sort out our think and relieve stress by having peace away from their heavy load of taks . However , I firmly believe that go on a trip alone is not the best way to travel because there are many dangerous vacation spots and it is time consuming .  First of all , traveling in a group of people with tour guide is much safer . It is a tour guid who knows well about the vacation spots based on their previous experience by living the place for a long time . we not only obtain accurate information that the place we should not go but also be protected with a members of group by moving with a lot of people . Therefore , by traveling with a group of people led by tour guide allows people not to face unexpected situation including lose their money by lobberies , meet gangsters and lose their way . For example , when I traveled Hong Kong alon two years ago , I went to the opposit direction to the park that I had planned to go . I could not speak chinese so , I could not ask anything to the people around me . I felt scared and cried all they long .  In addition , traveling with tour guid in a group is much time saving . This is because poeple does not have to make a schedual researching the information about famous place by comb through all the books and call all the hotels to reserve . Poeple just follow guided direction withouth worring to check the time schedule of transportation , wherher the hotel reservation is available or not . Without worring those things , people can spend more enjoyable time with goup of people by talking about their feelings and sharing impressions each other . To demonstrate , according to the research conducted of Labor of Korea in 2007 , 75 % people felt more memorable and enjoyable trip when they traveled with a group of poeple by tour guide . In addition , they answered that the reason why they felt happy with the trip is they does not have to worris about the information making trip .  For these reasons , traveling with a group of people is more advantageous to make their trip more fun because of the time and feeling of sager . I belive that people should take into account those things before they go on the trip alone .	KOR
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts . I agree with the statement for the following reasons , the importance of the capability to think logically , solve problems and to create future visions . The stated reasons are described in more detail in the following paragraphs .  First a students needs to learn how to think logically in order to understand a problem that needs to be solved . Especially for study assignments as well as work assignments it is important to determine what is the unknown factor , that needs to be found . If the students is not able to do that , the result might not be the factor that was initially asked for .  Second , if a student just learns facts instead of strategies to solve a proble the student will not be able to apply the already learned knowledge to a similar problem . For instance the student knows how to calculate the revenue based on price per product times units sold but as soon as the units sold is unknown and the given numbers are the price for each product and the total revenue , the student will not be able to solve for the units sold . In order to solve the outlined problem it is important that the student learns the strategy to solve a equation for different unknowns .  Third , only if a students understands the concept and idea of for instance a certain product like a car only then will the student be able to create further developments of the already existing features . If the student only focuses on learning facts the student will always limit his knowledge and learing to already existing ideas . Thus , the student will not be able to come up with future visions which are vital in somone 's accademical and professional carreer .  In conclusion , the ability of a student to think logically , solve problems and to create future visions or developments of existing knowledge or facts is more important to me than learning the facts . It will enable the student to be sucessful in his or her study as well as professional career .	GER
`` Education is what remains with you after you finish schooling '' The statement explains that it is the knowledge you learn that remains with you than the facts .  While at school students learn a number of facts and ideas . The huge academic syllabus is a combination of both facts and ideas . However the point that needs to be focussed on here is , `` How much do students remember afterall ? '' They remember only what they learn and not what they mug up . Therefore we can sum up as it is important to grasp concepts while at school than merely registering facts and forgetting them later on .  The endless chapters on history often fail to teach us what we are supposed to ` learn ' . For example , Alexander the great was a great conquerer . He conqured emdlessly . However being murdered and left was what reached him to the almighty . Here we need to appreciate his dynamism and heroism , not failing to see the other side of the coin that is , he was over confident and was consumated by his own avarice to conquer .  We need to formulate our education system where students can develop there mental capacity . A developed individual would be self confident , reliable and a good human being . In this context , the ealier system of education in India is worth having a look at . The then schools , called `` gurukuls '' , meaning house of the teacher , were considered sacred and holy . Students would focus more on learning and understanding . Ofcourse they were taught facts , but they knew how to use them and gain knowledge as well , which is the ultimate aim of education . A confident student , with understanding of basic concepts would be more successful than one who has simply mugged up facts which he will ultimately forget .	HIN
Well I would agree on that statement in some occasions or education levels in life , for example at school , but would usually disagree with it when it comes to studying in a University .  A student having general knowledge would have many basic information in many subjects , which seems to me as an advantage , but not all the information as a student specialized in a certain major or subject .  Having broad knowledge in an academic is realy benificial i life and may help , but I would preffer to have a specialized major because it will , or I think it would , offer more jobs for me to choose than that of a person with general knowledge and I would or can specialize in that subject more implies I could gain the masters and then the doctorate degrees more easilly .  Some people other than me would judge me as inccorect and would assign that having general knowledge might improve my life more than that of a specialized one , but nowadays people tend to get specialized or would rather have a major than having onformation on various subhjects that might have a negative impulse towards how that individual is beeing taught .  Looking at people in many countries having many majors might make a variaty and help people do what or learn what they want instead of having to learn information he/she does not want to or have difficulties in and do not want to complete with	ARA
It is a very common idea among young people that they are more enjoying life than older people , especially their parents ! But are you happy only when you have fun ? I do no think so . I belive that at each stage of your existence you `` enjoy life '' in a different way .  First , when you are young , you have no childs . One can consider that , as he has no constraints such as feeding his offspring , he is more enjoying life . But I think that I will be deeply happy when my child will grow up and become an autonomous human being . At that that time , despite all the constraints , I think that I will `` enjoy life '' .  In addition when you are young , even if your entertain yourself playing tennis for example , you can not do everything you want . You have to respect your parents rules . Being an adult allow you to choose your activities and experience new leisure . For example my mother used to prevent me from swiming because she was afraid of water . I discovered this sport quite late but now I really enjoy it . Moreover , when you are older , you start appreciating new activities . When I was young I found highly bizzare the idea of watching paintings for hours . But now I am fond of art exhibitions ! In the meantime I learned to enjoy life in a different manner .  Being older also enable to have a professional life . You can manage to reach great achievement and be financially rewarded for it . When I received my first income , I was really happy ! The idea of making money just using my brain still thrills me . It is a way of enjoying life that I never thought about when I was in my early ages .  In a nutshell I think that being happy and enjoying life is not a matter of age . It is more an ability to enjoy the best moments and learn from the worst . I hope being hppy with such a philosophy of life !	FRE
I believe strongly that the question seems to be controversial in one way and very relative because i can see that , it depends on persons ' views and thereby the conditions also under wich the travel is made .  In one hand , a tour guide is not bad , if i will try to picture the why of a tour guide or its purpose actually , i can really go further to illustrate that .  As i guess we all know nobody wants to be unsecure or not well protected , or not well guided . Why am i led to talk about people ? , for the simple reason that , travel is made mentionned and basically is has to do a lot with people .  For instance , if i have to talk more about the security aspect of the thing . When we see today , in the most technologicaly advanced century or age , the way people wants to be secured ; tbe it political leaders are guided or secured even countries . It really shows the long or the desire at the maximun of anyone wanting to be be secured .  So from this point of view , i can really see that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the good way of travelling in connection with some of the reasons that i have announced previously .  But i can also say that is not always necessary the only best way to travel . As i said formely , it can be relative i mean by also depending on people point of views of what is the best way of travelling . Because for some people , during their travels , they use means of transportation wich do not have a tour guide and all the same they qualify their travels always as being the best . So from this angle we really see the restriction of what is called best way of travelling wich is connected to being led by a tour guide .	FRE
I agree totaly with this statement , actualy the most richer people in the world and the biggest managers are persons who has taken risks in their lives to become what they are today . Often people are afraid to do things that goes out of ordinary because that may be does not work and they can find their selves with no jobs any more , no money , they con become a person who is out of the socity and rejected . Sometimes i think it is better to listen to our heart and to belives in our self and in our capacities and in our imagination and ability to create because we can be able to succeed even if there are risks to take , who 's knows we may be able to do so much extraordinary things if only we were more bravious ! In a other side i think that a person who is always doing the same things at work all his life is not happy , it is such borring to repeat the same things more and more , why ca n't we just blow all thease ennoying works away and realising our dreams ? We most not forgive that we have just one life in this earth so we mos I take the exemple of bill gates who is very famous . Bill gates when he was at the bigining of his cereer took the risk to put a new conception of way to use computer on the market of PC , a totaly new project . Others thought he was a fool but he succeded and today every body use his logiciel , every one knows microsoft 's logiciels , he is every where !	FRE
Although a lot of people believe that young people enjoy life more than older peolpe , i strongly disagree this belief . Enjoying the life doesn ' t depend on people 's age because it depends on people 's vision , expectation from life , and spirit .  Even though some people become young and , they aren ' t happy with life in that their vision is not enough to be happy . They think that some small obsctacles prevent them to be happy . For instance , I know a lot of old people they try to enjoy the life though they have some disablities . They are attend many activities to learn new things and have a good time . These are normal for them because this is their vision .  People expectations from the life change when they are different age . Older people believe that the most important thing is in the life is to be happy and they try to be happy during their older age on the grounds that they know better than young people that life is really short and they are doing their best during this time unlike young people .  Lastly , people 's spirit is the other essential factor in people lives . To be younger person is not important . This only provides people some advantages . For example , to spend more energy and do many things in a short time but old people organize their lives to do more things ( like trip , sports , etc . . ) to enjoy the life .  Consequently , to be happy is not really related with people age . There are other significant factors affects	TUR
Since cars were invented the number of them circulating has been growing and growing along with the improvment of technology . For this reason , I do not see why in twenty years there could be fewer cars than there are today . However , one could say that cars might be replaced by other very high tech means of transportation , but I think twenty years would not be enough to do so .  In my opinion , which is also a wish , in twenty years there will be more cars or as much as today , but maybe they will not pollute the enivronment as they do today . In fact , a lot has been already done to reduce pollution and I am sure there is still much that can be done . For example , Italian cities and other European cities are making Europeans buy Euro4 and Euro5 cars , which pollute way less than standard cars . This reduction has been possible thanks to improvements of cars technology . Every month around the world there are show rooms that present new kind of cars , less and less polluting , more and more sofisticated in shapes , motors and accessories . Some of these new kind of cars are very expensive , depending also on the brand , while some are cheaper . Industries are doing a lot for making people buy these cars , from rich people to less fortunate people . Not only industries and the most famous brands companies are acting in favour of less pollution . In fact , governments are doing a lot as well . For instance , they organize many information campaigns ; they define calendars of days during which people must not use cars in the cities where pollution is over the maximum level permitted and they finance electric pubblic transportation .  I think these are good reasons to retain that cars will not decrease in number for the next twenty years ; on the contrary it is common to expect them to be numerous but less polluting than they are today .

I disagree with the follwing statement . In fact , i hope to become a person that i 'll be specialized in one specific subject . Now , i 'm studying mechanic engineering at the university and when i 'll be finished , i 'm going to work in an industrial factory . So this is one reason on about i do n't agree with that opinion . In fact i have to learn always and always knowledgement about mechanic problems because this is a condition that it 'll let me to enter facily in the world of job . So i still have to study more to reach that goal . In spite of this consideration , to have broad knowledge of many subjects is a condition that can also give important results for the future . To know other arguments such as economy , literature or foreign languages is another opportunity and , with this culture you can have interesting results to improve your career . But i think that it 's better to know only a sector of own job . Maybe , one explanation can be given . Until i was a young boy and i was ten years old , i just had a clean idea about what i'be have wanted to do when i 'd have became an adult . So i always wanted to be an engineer . My father is an engineer and also my grandfather was an engineer and maybe this can be one factor of my choiche and of my opinion about this statement . So , i went to the Tecnichal School and i receveided a diplome as mechanich . Now i am a student of Politecnico University and hope to have the degree as soon possible .	ITA
Doing what you already can its surely a save way . It allows you to concentrate on one topic and be as good as you can in it . You professionalice and may become an expert if you are doing what you really want to do and if you are totaly satisfied with it .  But in my opinion , it is sometimes better to take risks and try something new . Even if you are happy with your work or living situation you can become even better and happier by gaining new experiencing .  Moving to a foreign country , Studying abroad or learning a nother language . It opens up your horizon and lets you experience new situations and possibilitys , you would probably not be able to experience . Living in a different country for example , lets you not just learn about something new , it shows you also a lot about your own country or heritage . It helps to better understand cultural missunderstandings and about yourselfe , by experiencing several different situations or activitys makes you more diverse and spreads your possibilities .  You can use the experiences at your work , hobby or private life . You become a wholer person and contribute that to society . You are able to talk about a fariety of topics and form your life more interressting and make it more We never stop learning and should try to learn as much as we can do about the world .	GER
Many people have the opportinity to change the wold . Meanwhile others keep in the same way in theirs lives . I agree with the statement that says `` successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . ''  Innovation is the key for succes . According to the news times , everything is changed quickly . For example , the technology . We can find from simple calculators to moder satellites in the space . The new technology is given us the opportunity to learn faster and better . If you do not have new things the life will be dull . Thomas Alba Edison the great inventor for example invented more the fifty devices and gives the ligth . He changed the world forever .  Innovation give us better quality of life . For example computers , you can use the media for many purposes , you can shopping , banking , learn and take TOEFLtest in the internet . It is becuause admirable people have innnovation and creativity . Not only in the technology area but also in the medicine field we have improving our lives . Innovations permit that diseases that killed many people in the past be cure with the new technology and knowledge .  In conclusion , i believe that innovation and risk improve the chances to have a bettre life . The time is now	SPA
While life can be enjoyed by people in all phases of life , I personally believe that young people enjoy life more .  Main factor in favor of young people is their high energy levels . Young people are full of life and like to experiment different options . Such experimentation builds their life experiences . Exercising different options provides multiple opportunities to enjoy life .  Younger people have higher physical strength to endure outdoor activities . For example , while a senior citizen may require a detailed planning and preparation before they could take an adventure camping , young people could combine their youth with sense of adventure to take up such a trip with little or no planning .  Young people also have time on their side to take risks . Unlike , older people who are risk averse , young people can take higher risks . Young people realize that in case of any negative consequence , they will have time to repair the damage . This risk friendliness allows young people to stretch their limits and enjoy life to the fullest .  While it is true that young people do not have enough time in their schedules as compared to older people . However to enjoy life , time is not the sole requirement . Young people have multiple outlets to enjoy life - at work , home or socializing . Hence a person need not wait till retirement to enjoy life .  Most of life 's enjoyments will require commitment of financial resources also . It is likely that smart older people would have achieved financial success to enjoy life , however it is more probable that young people will have more expendable income to enjoy life .  In conclusion , while life can and should be enjoyed in every phase of life , young ones should capitalize on this opportunity . Young people have all supporting factors in their favor to enjoy life to the fullest .	HIN
We all know that cars can represent ones status , and that is nothing about how the price it is or how convenient the public transportations are . Thus , I disagree with this topic by following three reasons .  I do not agree with this topic because , first , cars will less polluted to the enviroments in twenty years . Teconology is going more and more advanced now . In the future , we will not use gas or petroleum to drive the car . We will use electicity to replace the gas or petroleum . Thus , the air will goes fresh , and the greenhouse effect will decline as well . This will make enviromental group to support people to drive .  I do not agree with this topic because , second , when you drive a car , you can feel calm , save , and warm . You can drive to anywhere with your family , just wherever they want to arrive . You can have your own space that public transportations could not give you . You can also not be bothered from other people when on the way to your destination . This reason is really important to the person who has family or children .  I do not agree with this topic because , third , you can show the status you are . For instance , you can drive Benz to buy the fruits or vegetables , and that will make everyone know that you are rich . Also , when you meet your old friends , which means you are invited from old friends , you can let them know that you are not the one before ! I know this sounds like arrogant , but it is practical right ?  To sum up , many people might advocate another opinion . However , according to the three main reasons I said , I totally disagree with the topic that in twenty years the cars will less .	CHI
Have n't you ever wondered why the laundry we see on TV is always perfectly clean after washing but we still find some stains when we wash at home ? This essay will discuss the issue that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Firstly , the product is always in a perfetct light when we see it in an advertisement . Obviously , the producing firm does not want to show the product under worse circumstances . They want to sell the product in order to gain some profits . Therefore it seems reasonable to me to show it in a rather perfect light . For instance , if someone drives a car in an advertisements he drives the car through a picturesque landscape . But we often face noisy traffic jam in dirty cities . Obviously the actor in the add seems to have more fun driving the car . Furthermore , the adds are often supported by music to stimulate the consumers desire to obtain the product . The sound of beautiful music also supports that the product looks better than it looks the noisy real life . Moreover , the actors in the advertisements are always happy and they really know how to use the product . Sometimes we experiance some difficulties by using a product simply because we do not know how to use it proberly . Imagine a new cellphone . There are so many functions , we sipmly do not know how to handle it with all its possible features .  To conclude , I agree that the products seem better that they really are because in our daily life we are not using them under the perfect circumstances . But as far as I am concerned , this is no problem as long the basic statement of an advertisement is true and if we are aware of the fact that our daily life differs from the one we see on TV .	GER
Advertisements , many factories and companey make advertisements to let the people know about their new products and sometimes they say true thing about it 's products and sometimes wrong , so how we can know the ture ?  first of all , we can know if this product is good or now by asking people who try it . For examply , if you cousin see on the TV an advertisement about a machine that is useful , let we say that it is a sport machine , as we know in the TV they will say a lot of thing about it that will let the people like it and buy it without wondering how much does it cost , so your cousin bought it . Then you hear about this machine and you are wondering if it is good , because if it is good you will buy it , so you make up your mind to ask your cousin about it , but unfortunatly he/she told you that it is not good , and it broke from the first day . So when you heard this , surly you will decide not to buy it , so it 's a way to know if the product that you hear about it in and advertisement is worth to buy it or no .  Second , if you really like a product that you saw in an advertisement , why do n't you buy it ? .. you wo n't lose anything , try it , perhaps it will be better than you thought , everthing is possible , but be sure of what you are doing , and try not to lose so much money in things that you do n't need , just but the things that you really need .  to sum up , advertisements will be useful in many times , because it will let you know new products that you have been searching for it for a long time then you will find it in an easy way . so you should be up to date with new advestisement because sometimes it 's good .

Car has became a part of life in the modern life . car is very much essential today to do the things in the right time . I disagree with the given statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .  In the olden days man used to travel from place to another by walking . the invention of the wheel chaged the evolution greatly . after the invention of wheel man introduced many new vechicles for transportation . he initially used bullock carts , tongas which were pulled by animals .  In the later life he introduced bicycle , which served him in travelling later he introduced motor cycle inorder to reach quickly with less effort , inthis process man thought for luxirious way of travelling and he started to introduced vechicles run by fuel . he designed some of them for transportation of goods , and some for human , such as trucks , buses respectively .  And he later thought about the luxory and privacy , then brought the cars . cars were luxirious means of transportation in the earlier . but it is a compulsory now . this change had occured because of globalisation and neccesities . in the intial stages there very less number of cars , people used to see it very intrestingly . but now days in the developed countries many are having more than one car .  The main problem with the cars is they create alot of traffic problems and also pollution . for this reason many governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding for more tax , parkingamounts .  But pepole are ready to pay that because they very much edicted to it . the question is that there will be less cars with in 20 years than now but ithink it will not happen . the people possessing cars will not throw them out .  There will be many technologies come which will reduce pollution already some are using cars run by solar power . The other reason is that popullation is increasing day - day .  And iconclude from the above reasons that after twenty years the number of will not be decreased instead the go on increase .	TEL
I can not really agree with the opinion stated above . I think that understanding concepts , as well as learning facts , are equally important .  On the one hand , it is very important to understand an underlying idea . It is the base to apply it to new contexts and to connect it with other concepts . It is an essential ability to suceed in exams and it even enables the further development of new hypotheses or even whole theories . In my opinion , real understanding proves if someone is an intelligent , independent thinking person . And these are necessary attributes for a successful researcher and a satisfying academic career .  For example , the principle of many basic learning theories , investigated by Skinner , where cited by numerous other researchers . The researchers conducted many interesting experiments , resulting in highly useful applications .  In the other hand , you can not deny the importance of knowledge of facts . Surely , the solely learning of facts was exaggerated for a long time . Whole generations of students only had to repeat information without having to prove their understanding . I totally agree , that this does not make any sense . I also permit that it is hard work to learn them and it seems senseless from time to time .  Nevertheless , facts are important . It is not sufficient if researchers have understood a main principle . They have to know all included variables of a theorie , how the experiment were conducted , why , in which content . They should be aware in which time period a theorie was invented and a fact was discovered and by whom . This is all fruitful background information .  The first things to learn are facts . Then understanding of the underlying idea is the next important step . And finally the further connection and application follows . The last step could not be achieved if one of the earlier steps would be missing .  Therefore I draw the conclusion that you can not say which of the two learning strategies is more important for a student .	GER
I totally agree that in the next twenty years or so there will be much fewer cars in use than there are today . Although it may not be evident in the present scenario with car sales gong up each year but many factors like pollution , space crunch and increase of public awareness will see the more and more people relying on public transportation as their sole means for travelling .  With the price of gasoline skyrocketing beyond general public 's purchasing capability , people are slowly realizing that their cars are becoming more of a liability to them . It is highly unlikely that the fuel prices will ever decrease given the limited resources of fossil fuels .  Cars based on unconventional sources of energy like fuel cells , solar power etc are yet to establish their financial viabilty . All these factors suggest that people will look upto public transportation as a permanent solution to their woes . Besides being lighter on purse the statistics suggest that it is much more safer mode of transportation than cars .  Also exploding population in metropolitan cities is leading to major space crunch on roads and parking lots . People are fed up of wasting hours in traffic jams and parking queues . They are realizing that if most of them use public transportation , it would benefit all in terms of driving space and time . Non polluting vehicles like cycles are once again gaining popularity among masses for various resons , health being a prominient one . Infact many people in China go to their offices daily on bicycles .  Therefore , it seems that the idea of the `` Ford '' , the famous car manufacturer , to ensure car for all may not came true . With government strongly promoting the benefits of public transportation and increasing awareness among public reagarding the disadvantages of owning and driving a car we will see a sad but necessary demise of the era of cars .

In today 's world , it is highly debated that if a person have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one subject . That is , `` specialization and all in one '' concepts are argued to determine which is better . In this essay , I will try to explain my opininos about the issue which I wrote above . Before from writing details of my opinion , I would like to say that I believe the power of specialization and disagree with the statement which is given in the question .  The need and requirements of academical environment is changing . And I think the trend is going through to specialization . Specialization means knowing every sides and aspects of any subject covering all of the details . There is a word in my country Turkey which underlines the importance of specialization : `` Instead of knowing something elses about every subjects , knowing everything of a one subject is better '' . As soon as I had read the statement in the question , I remembered this sentence . And I believe the message of this sentence .  Specialization in one subject brings a lot of advantages to person who is related to it . I would like to explain one of the advantages by giving example from university life . In Turkey 's universities there are Business Administration Faculties and under these faculties there is an `` International Trade Department '' which I would like to be specialized in . And when I got the University Entrance Exam , there were two choices in front of me . One is studying business administration second one is studying international trade . In Turkey , the international traders are % 100 graduated from business and they are not international trade specialist . So , when I had realized this situation , I decided to study international trade , and try to get specialize in international trade . And nowadays I see the advantages of this , majority of the Foreign Trade Departments of Companies are looking for International Trade Specialist .  The another point that I am considering as an advantage of specialization is ; if someone asks you what is your job ? or what is your main interested point ? you w 'll be able to give accurate responses . That is , the people and yourself will easily be able to know what are you doing and what you are specialized for . For example if the doctors are not specialized in any type of specializition , they will not have any specialized topic , and again a Turkish sentence `` they will say I can do any thing ( job ) that you want me to do '' .  In conclusion ; specialization is the t	TUR
Being committet to your community can have various forms . It starts from helping your family in its daily chores , taking care of the neighbours ' house while they are away or spending some time in charities organisation . At the core of all the above is the recognition that we are not just individual , but part of a community . There is also the sense of gratitude for one 's gifts in life , such as youth , health or any skills , and the sense of enrichment that comes from sharing those gifts and making them useful to others .  Overall I agree with the idea that young people do not seem focused enough on the needs of their communities , and I actually think that they are fairly detached from the concept of community altogehter . I think this is a very complex phenomenon and linked to a great number of reasons .  First of all , it seems that our society and culture put a high value on time , especially spare time . Partly because modern life is very demanding , partly because the offer of entertainment and outdoor stimulations is so varied , we praise our time as a supreme luxury and feel very frustrated when we can not use it in complete frredom .  Secondly , I think Western societies have developed more and more in a hedonistic direction . In other words , we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves , feel free in our choices and simply follow instant gratification . I think this is particularly apparent in young people , as they claim they right to play and have fun , and resent any request of help or support as a form of injustice .  In a dominant culture of self-absorption and pleasure , taking the time to communicate with people that are different , for background and frame of mind , seems unjustified and this leads to another worrying trend . It seems to me that there is a general detachment between young people and older generations or people in need . These are generally the people that need more time and support within the community , and it would be the duty of the younger generation to look after them .  In conclusion , I think that values that have become more and more present in our societies are now central in young people 's vision of life . As a consequence , there seems to be a more selfish conception of one 's use of time and gifts , that unfortunately leads to the neglect of parts of teh community that might be in need .	ITA
In my opinon , most advertisements are deceiving people by making products seem better . There are two specific cases of examples of tricks to present products much better : changing the look of the product by changing its color of its cover and changing its name to make it look like high quality .  First of all , advertisements change the color of the products cover to attract the customers . Generally faded colors will make the customer think that product is made with an old technology , whereas bright colors deceive the consumer that it is made by high technology . For example , brighter pencils are generally preferred to faded-colored-pencils in Turkey . That 's why many advertisers force manufacturers to produce bright looking pencils to increase selling .  Secondly , advertisers force the manufacturers to change product names of a specific product to increase the amount of products sold . In Turkey , that is usually done by giving a foreign name to that product instead of a Turkish name to trick the consumer . In this way , consumer may think that the product is a high quality product because some of the goods manufactured by Turkish industry lacks quality . There is a real case for this in Turkey . A-spagetti-producing-company changed its product name a couple of years ago and gave an Italian name to its product to deceive the consumer that it is an Italian product . Hence , they have increased selling their products . This is the way to present their products much better although it is same quality as before .  To sum up , most advertisers make products seem much better according to some techniques listed above . Unfortunately , this techniques are becoming so widespread that consumer will unlikely encounter a product revealing its real quality .	TUR
I do agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , for the reasons that being adventurous can expand one 's vision , and help one catch new opportunities Firstly , trying new things and taking risks can expand one 's vision . The course from good to great of the world-famous company Well Fargo is one of the best example to support this idea . Well Fargo was a indeed American company for the reason that it pays only 1 percent of the entire attention of the company , to its international department . One day , the top leader of Well Fargo took a big risk : he place the company 's chief CEO , who had been in charge of over 60 percent of the entire business of the company , in the international department . Everyone was confused with the decision of the leader of trying new things . However , Well Fargo succeeded . After several years of the replacement of their chief CEO , Well Fargo became not only a big American company , but a huge international business as well . The expansion of vision enabled Well Fargo to reach out and became a great company , and make its leader a successful manager as well .  Secondly , trying new things and taking risks can help one catch new opportunities . Living in a fast-pacing world like this , we faces new challenges every single day . If we only stick to the daily routine without getting to know this world better by trying new things and taking risks , we will surely be left behind by those who are more adventurous . With closed eyes , we may never reach the destine opportunities even when they are just knocking on our doors .  Ready and willing to try new things and taking risks , one will finally become successful from mediocrocy . Starting from today , our new lives with open minds will bring us something amazing sooner or later .	CHI
Korean parents , who has traditionally shown huge intersts on childern 's education , seem to be competing to send their chidren to most munber of private academies . I should admit that childern should accumulate a lot of knowlege to understand the world , or the lead a successful life in the futer . However , I believe that more emphasis should be put on understanding the ideas and concepts .  First of all , compulsion of acquiring lots of knowledge will make the student lose the interests on the subject they 're studying . When a student is force to go to several privite academies by his mom 's wish like one of my students , she wo n't have chance to consider what I want to know the most . As a matter of a fact , the student spents lots of time studying English , math and science but all she wishes about the academies is to quit them .  Moreover , just gaining more knowlede beyond the student 's understanding is not efficient at all . For example , another student of the academy where I teach , should take 3 coursed every day . Of course , it is not by his will but by his mom 's wish . In spite of the amount of time he spends at the academy , he fails to show decent understanding for any of the classes . Because he takes too much , he is having a hard time understanding the lessons .  Undoubtedly , having a lot of knowledge is very useful and important . However , I believe the study process should follow the steps neede to be efficient . Students should have chance to learn about what it is like . For that they should understand the field .	KOR
I do not completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , simply because it depends on what the definiton of `` fun '' means to these people .  Fun for young people , specially for an adolescent could mean a lot of things like hanging out with his friends , throwing birthday parties or even studying for an intellectual young individual that is . My point is fun could mean a lot of things to a lot of different people . For the older people fun could mean just watching television or going for a long walk . For example , my grandfather who is about 75 year old has a lot of fun having food of his kind . Yes , this is true when a person has reached a particular age he starts pleasing himself or having fun with venial things like these . This does not mean that he is n't enjoying his life . He has his own ways to enjoy it .  Younger people might enjoy life as they are presently but this does not mean older people have not done what the younger people have . Moreover , the older people have done everything the younger people have . What this means is , enjoying life and fun go hand in hand and also changes as needs of the people changes when they grow older . It all depends upon what the individual pleases himself with , to have fun at that particular age like in my grandfather 's case in was the kind of food he liked to eat . In my cae its enjoying life sitting on my roof top with a guitar .  Hence , commenting on the statement I would like to assert that fun could mean different for different people . Therefore , older people have as much fun as younger people do , the only difference is the means of having fun or satisfying themselves .	HIN
I completely disagree , mainly for three reasons .  First is that althought youth typically implies health and will to do things in life . The truth as I see it is that the act of enjoying life is something that is defined as well as happens in our minds within ourselves and is not something completely dependent on how many years does one have . As an example of this there are the lots of young people that live in deep depression , sometimes clynical sometimes not , that clearly do not enjoy life .  It is clear that the example given in the paragraph above can be reverted . But that brings me precisely to my second point . For me is not accurate nor completely correct to make generalizations about a so subjective thing as people enjoying life more than other people .  How do we compare the enjoying of one group versus the enjoying of other ? and what is the meaning of enjoying life ? All of this make me more suspicious about the given statement .  Now , my third objection is foreshadowed in the last paragraph . What do we mean by the phrase `` enjoying life '' ? It is obvious that althought there may be a certain consensus between some people about the meaning of that phrase , enjoying life does not mean the same for everyone . Less problable it is that it will mean the same thing for older and younger people . So it may be possible that older and younger people enjoy the life the same but within their own definitions of what is enjoying life .	SPA
I think education is a combination between the understanding of concepts and the learning of facts .  Concepts are important in the way they are the essence of the knowledge that the teacher needs to transmit to the students . They are the structure , to built that strong construction that supports all the academic tasks . Without concepts we will live in a world that does n't worry and take the time to penetrate the deepest parts of the understandiyng and mental capacity .  Sometimes education can turned to square and bored the learners , because everything is about ideas and how to get them . To pill the onion or to get to the center of the point , we need details , little facts that decorate our lives and the way we learn to see and understand the universe .  Good educators are the ones that can awake their studendts throught a simple fact as a date o a number ( that can be eassily fogotten ) using it as door to walk and search into an unknown universe full of posibilities that let her/him to understand the ideas that once we introduced we never forget .  It is like a game . When we play to find the treasure we can not forget our objective , but we have to be carefull of the facts and the extra information that we can collect during the search . The middle way is the best way to educate and help students to understand different disciplines from mathematics to arts , because is the perfect combination between body and what is inside it . When we fallow thios way we find the gold , the wisdom .	SPA
Evolution has prooven that , specialized organisms as well as organisms that have refraind form specializing have endured . Specialists were able to ensure their survival by fitting into a single vacant ecological gap in which they flourished . Unspecialized organism have to rely on their flexibility ; and that is exactly their advantage . Because , they are not specialized and are dependent of their flexibility , they are more capable of adapting to a new situation . Oraganism that do n't adapt die and eventually their entire species will become extinct . One can easily project that image on human fields of knowledge . Being able to build life decisions on a great base of knowledge is more profitable then being specialized in only one field be it an academic subject or set of ideas and values .  Being able to adapt is of greatest necessity . It is part of everyone 's everyday life , you adapt to the people you talk to , you adapt to the people you work with , and you even adapt to your own family . If you have been specialized in one field it would probably be the one of greatest interrest to you , this does not mean though that all the people around you shre your enthusiasm about the same subject , which means that one has to be able to talk about other mayor topics in life . Granted , being a professional specialized in something vital does serve one well in the modern world in sense of economical seccurity , but what good does it do when you posess omnipotet knowledge of one field but are incapable of seeing the conections to another ? When the company , in which someone was the specialist for that and only that specific company 's computer network , goes bankrupt , he is jobless .  I belive that broadening one 's own horrizon , be it intellectually or emotionally , more likely grants a secure and fullfilled duture	GER
Can it be that people turns to use horess and camals again for transportation ? I dont think soo , people over time are being better and better in discoviries , and the day will come when they start using airships and viecles that will be able to fly . I agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the divlopment in discoviry , and the spread of air transportation .  In every new generation there are new minds and new people that thinks about life in a different way . With all the discoviries that have been done and the new minds whicj are comin to the world they will surely discover a new way of transportation that will make cars dissappear .  Nowadays air crafts and air transportaion is the largist kind of transportation in the world , and with all this spreading in this kind of transportation and the knoledge in it are making cars a way of transportation that will not last .  therefor , i think that cars woud'nt last and there will be some other ways to move from some place to another in less time and less affort .

I agree with that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .  The great oppourtinity to go to some different places comes . It 's better to go by group and with a tour guide . Because , we do n't know the history of the places and we do n't know the manoments of the place . If we have an tour guide , Then he knows all about the history of the place .  While we are having a tour guide , we have no worry about to plan a schedules for were to vist . Because , the tour guide knows all the places in perticular location or all . He may planes the schedules by our requirments . Generally , he knows all places and moreover he is having myraid collection for the historic events which we have to know . Which is the best place to see first and which is the place to see last .  The tour guide guides where we have to stay , approximate budget for the planning of the tour . And he may knows the shortcuts to vist more places and bording and lodging facautilies . He explains about the places with there people cultures , behavoiurs and historic events of that places .  We may save the money while we are having a tour guide by his right direction about the shopping , lodging , boarding etc . Because , he is having lack of experiance in travelling and in demonistration different places .  If we are able to go without guide . Then some of the problems will occurs as , we do n't know the specific location correctly . We do n't know where we have vist moreover we do n't know the historic events of the places . We may have a chance to divert the root maps .  So , It 's better to go with the tour guide who is very helpfull in all different angles .	TEL
In order for any person to succseed , it must under go many phases , experience , events , and even go though risks . To succseed in your life you must try new ways or methods in dealing with other people or situations , this will increas the knowledge , experience and excitment in your life . By doing this you might change your life from a failing depressed life to a successful life .  If a person will not take any risks or try anything risky in his life , he will lead a dull boring life . For example , if you have a fear of hights , you might take a big decision in your life and go try bungi jumping . You might wonder how will this affect my life to the better . This experience willl enforce your self confidence and self esteam . It will change you to a person who is strong and not afraid of facing his/her fears .  Another example is that if you work at home and you do your work manually , but at the same time you are good at it and know how to do it will . This might be good in some way , but on the other way is boring and might make you depressed . If , for example , you decide to introduce a computer to your work , but you fear anything that is new and has to deal with techonlogy ; this might stress you out . You should take the risk and attend a coures that teaches you computer . By facing this fear in your life you and your business will turn out successfully . It will also help you floresh your work and save time , and at the same time faced your fears and built your confidenc .  In order to be a succesful perosn you got to try new things and take risks in life rather than doing what you already know what to do . This will increase your selfesteam and spice up your life .

The number of cars is a problem nowadays . It 's a problem because reserves of petrole are going to be smaller and smaller and because of thism the price of petrole is growing and growing .  Nowadays , the environmental question is very popular in european countries and cars are considered as a very bad element for the environment 's health . So , in my opinion , in twenty years , the number of cars in Europe , Japan and United States will be lower . But , in my opinion , cars will be fewer in twenty years than today in developping countries ( in poorer countries ) like africans countries or south americans countries because for them , cars still a very important element fort the economy growth . People of those countries use a lot their cars in order to go to their jobs whereas , in countries which are already developped and rich , people used to take the subway , buses and the tramway . But , because the poorer polution represent a big part of the worldwide population , if all those people are going to have a car , the wodldwide nu ; ner of cars will dra ; atically grow . There is also the problem of the lobbying . The car lobbying is very i ; portant in the Unites States of America so , they will not allow the American government to make a law about the number of car per family . So if some people would like to make the nu ; ber of cars smaller , they will be in conflict with politicians and the lobbying . In ; y opinion , in twenty years , there will be a terrible struggle between the environmental proctectors and cars constructors ( General Motors , Ford , VW . .. ) . I 'm very sure that Green Peace will be a more and more important organisation because who does n't want to take care of our environment ? In my opinion , the number of cars can be also smaller in twenty years because circulation 's problems are terrible in big cities such as Paris or NYC . That 's why nowadays , cars are forbidden in the center of London . Because of this interdiction , I 'm very sure that a big part of londonian sell their cars and did n't buy a new one . Cars become useless in London . I heard also that Paris would like to make the same . Is n't that an evidence of the fact that the number of cars in Europe is going to be smaller .  As a conclusion , we cam say that in some parts of the world , in twenty years , cars will be fewers but in an other part , their number is going to be less important .	FRE
I disagree with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . I would like to putforth examples and situations I personally have experiences to support my opinion .  A person who travels alone I believe will have a lot more independency in making his own decisions rather travelling along with a tour guide . With a tour guide we see our desicion being influenced by the guide and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see . It was in my school trip that my classmates and myself had a pretty bad exerience with the guide appointed to us . The guide would take us to places we did n't want to see and he being a localite got us into a hotel that was quite expensive , because by doing so he would get a commission from the hotel authorities for getting them customers . Other than that we had some other bad exeriences only because of the reason that the guide was a localite and was looking for grabbing commission wherever we went .  The best advantage in travelling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the localites or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide us to the best places of visit . In today 's advanced world we get to have the information of a place on our fingertips through the internet . We also have amazing travel guide books that come in various languages and help us in getting a feel of the local culture .  I would like to end the topic on the point that I took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experiences that where great just because of the fact that we did n't take guide along .

very hard to understand many facts , if it is not related by ideas & concepts & examples . .. i think both attach to each other cose with out the the facts their is no ideas . for example in the war , why the war does not stop . it is been since the old centary we have war , and everyone know the bad results of thw war : hungyness , pauverety , too much people go away , fritness , people with psychology problems , kids who lost there parents , family who lost there own home . ..  but for my opinion the student understand all the ideas and concepts , in the history about all the wars , during all the history , but if they can learn from the facts this will not happen again .  another example more closer . when the teacher explain about a psychologie problem at class if he say the fact like : people still they have psychologie problems , every student will wonder why ? when he explain that many people who have emotional hungreness ( their mother didnt really offer to much lets say love to there kids ) and didnt teach her kids the right and wrong . this people love to still not because they need it , but sometimes to satisfate there emotionel .  in a busniss class when the proffessour said `` the costmers always right '' .when he conyinue explaining his idae we understand what he means : the busniss with out customers does n't work . it does n't matter the company what she thinks , but the customers who consumes this product .  for example when the constummer is been treating good he will be your door to another custommers , ( friends , neighbours , cousins , family . .. ) . but if he is not satisfate he will tell everyone and it will be a very bad reputation . everywhere not only at class even at home with our kids , family i think it hard to learn facts if their no ideas and concepts to understand .

The best way to travel will depend on the particular character , personality and needs of each person . However , when you are traveling in a group led by a tour guide you can miss the most real important things from the places you are visiting .  Having a tour guide will defnitly take you to the most ` common ' areas and you will be able to have a picture of yourself infront of the most known places in the world , nevertheless this you can also have doing a photomontage and placing yourself where ever you want to .  What it really gives value to a travel and what it makes worth it to visit a new place is the people and the new cultural difference they can show and share with you . The people is what builds a specific society and the people is the one that gives the specific place its own personality , either shown by a building or even also shown by their particular dishes .  There are many examples of the new wonders you can find if you really are willing to talk with the locals . However there is not enough time to have several examples to share , therefore lets take one specific Country like Germany . This example can be narrow even more taking one of the areas like the Baden-Wuttemberg . This area is known more to have the very famous castle known for almost everybody , the Cindirella Castle . Disney was taking this castle as his most importan logo and practicaly importilized it , and now it is being visited by people all around the world . However once you are there , eventhou the sight is beautiful and the walk to the inside of the castle shows a very nice passage , there is almost nothing else to see there and almost no time to enjoy it since there is too many people on a queue infront of you and behind you . In the mean time you are loosing the great oportunity of visiting other castles , even nicer ones in a more calm way .  The food is another very good argument why it is better to travel by yourself and giving yourself the chance to relate with the local people . It is amazing but no matter where you go , you will find a McDonalds . If you are with a tour guide and there is time , maybe he/she will take you to a very expensive restaurant and most probably will not have the typical meals of the area . On the other hand if there is no time and the tourist guide consider that there is not enough time , and lets emphazise on the fact that this tourist guide is the one making the decisions for you , there will be a high probability of having the famous hamburgers mentioned before . If you take the time , the locals will really appreciate it , you may even be lucky enough and have a meal at grandmas place . There is nothing more delicious than that .  There are many reasons to say why it is better to travel by your own , which does not mean to travel alone , than to travel in a group lead by a tour guide , but self experience will determine it at the end and it will give you the true reasons to choose between them . If I have to choose , I will defnitly always try to have my own trip with my own itinerary .	SPA
Today , I am going to talk about my opinion on the topic which is most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are . I agree with the topic . I have a experience that I bought a bag through the Internet . When I saw the bag though the Internet , I was eagering to have that big bag right away . So , I bought that bag with the credit card . When I recieve the bag , I was disappoint to the bag which is not as big as the photo . Then I swore not to buy any bags through the Internet anymore . My parents had bought a masage machine through the television . They said that it seems to be very comfortable and would make them feel relax . So , they determined to buy that . But they felt that machine is not as comfortable as they thought . They said the person who use it to masage seems really satisfied . How come they did not have the same feeling as that person ? My older brother had bought through the Internet , too . He bought a T-shirt which size is XL and have a really cool design on it . But when he received that T-shirt , he have difficulty to wear it on . So , I agree with this statement .	CHI
A common idea is if you do n't take risk , you wo n't succeed . Of course in our modern society the high number of people who want to succeed make the success more difficult to get . And as a result you have to take some risk . Nevertheless you have to be carefull because of the society you have to take risk but if you miss your objectif even with a fall short , the society wo n't forget it . And you wo n't be a successful person ( for a long time at least ) .  At the contrary if you do n't take risk you wo n't be successful . The society is always moving forward and if you want to follow and to succeed you can not remain and wait , without changing . So if you are changing something you are taking a risk even if it 's a very small risk . If you do n't adapt your business , your life or your job could get worse .  From my opinion a sucessful person took some risks , it 's compulsory . There 's too many people and too many business on earth so if you want to suceed you have to take risks . But the border between success and nothing or even something worse is very thin . So you have to take risks but you have to be very carefull . It means the more risks you take the more chances you have to succeed but as well higher will be the fall if you do n't succeed .  In conclusion i think in our society the only way to succeed is to take some risks but to be very carefull . Because i think as well a very good way to loose everything is to take too many risk . It means if you want to be successful you have to stay in the border between not enough risks and too many . And i think the most successfull people keep this border very thin .	FRE
Although some people , perhaps marketing majors , may argue that a product consists both of its physical form and of the good advertisements that present it , even if they are not so correct , I do not agree at all with this view . In my opinion , a product must be judged as good and , of course bought , according to its quality and advertisements should be based on the quality of the product and should not make the product seem better than it really is .  The main concern of this marketing habit is that low quality products are actually invading the market and the consumers can not distinguish between a good item and an item which is only well presented . Furthermore , in spite of its low quality , a product of the latter kind is often much more expensive .  As an example we can take Timberland shoes . In my country I see a lot of people buying them only because they have been influenced by the advertisements . Moreover , the shoes with that brand cost nearly three times the price of a high quality pair of shoes you can usually find in a shop , the difference between the two is the misleading advertisements . However , I do not mean that Timberland shoes are a low quality product , but of course , the sole difference between these and the ones that are not presented in the same way , is the price .  I could also have brought more meaningful examples but the problem would remain the same , we should care more about quality and the quality-price ratio .	ITA
It is really interesting to find out that , in nowadays , more and more advertisements become appeared on televison , newspaper , internet and many distinctive kinds of medias . And it is true that such advertisements have significantly increased the popularity of certain kinds of commodities and meanwhile encouraged much more customers . However , we may also have heard of some newspaper reports about the complaints of such kinds of commodities from customers . Usually , the complaints are mainly about that the products are not actually have the effects appeared on advertisements .  Therefore , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Firstly , some advertisements might be so exagerrated that creat some new effects which the products do not possess . I have just read from newspaper that one woman bought a television but then she found that there are many functions missing compared to what the advertisement . For example , in the advertisement , it says clearly that this kind of television can receive the TV programs overseas without adding any adjunctions on it . However , the woman found out that her television did not have such function at all .  Moreover , some advertisements may reach an extent that change the defects of the products to some virtual fascinating advantages . And what is more incredible is that such virtual advantages may become the shiny reasons that encourage customers to purchase the products .  Finally , in order to make more customers to buy the products , advertisements may try to eliminate the defects of such products . That is to say , only the advantages of products will appear on the corresponding advertisements . As we know , there wo n't exist something that is perfect and without any disadvantages or defects . Although such advertisements say the truth and the products really possess those advantages , they still send some wrong information to customers and to make their first impressions on the products become much better than they really are .  Therefore , from the discussion above , we can come to a conclusion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	CHI
I agree the statement that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' because generally people want to visit different places to relax themselves and wants to know more about different places . If they wont keep tour guide they takes much time to know about the place . At the same time if a person goes alone to visit the places , he doesnt get interest to watch the palces and he cant express his ideas , thoughts about the palce what he see . If it is the case , that he travels along the group and with tour guide , makes the peoples tour successful and happy because the tour guide can explains about the places briefly and interestingly providing a well knowledged tour guide . If the person travel along the group he can have a advantage to express his views and get other views about thr place they see .  Generally tours are included with long time night and day journey . At this time tour guide can where to stop the vehicle for emergency and where should not . At the same time if anything happens to anyone , others can help out in solving the problem they face . By travelling in a group along with tour guide they can help out each other and they can make thier most successful .  During journey , they face many problems like food , shelter for changing clothes etc . If the people go tour along group they can help out in providing shelter , food and other small and big problems .  If suddenly vehicle break down and if it takes few hours to repair then they can have nice time with thier mates . Simply they pass the time happily and unforgettable . Anyways thats all depends on the individuals but going along with group makes the individual to see the things happily and great scope to have good knowledge on place what they see .  If we take an example of industrial tour of engineering students like Tata motors in India etc . There i definately prefer to go along with group because they have to recollect their subject when they see the industry . At the same time your professor acts as tour guide . No one can recollect the information at that moment what they studied but if you go with a group they can share their own knowlege with other such that they can see the things more interstingly and gain more knowledge . Similarly if a office staff wants to improve thier industry , there it is need to visit higher industries and should make points what should improve in their industry . This is possible only when he goes along with teammates and guide . He can point out very good things if he discuss the things with his mates . At the same he need not to spend much time to know the unknown thing as guide is provided for them .  Thus i can strongly agree that The best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide .	TEL
Having broad knowledges of many academic subjects has some advantages and disadvantages . It is certain that having several opinions about different subjects should be better than not having . However , a lot of people are specialized in one specific subject , and they are also good and bad points about it  People who have kowledge of many academic subjects are should be certainly more advantaged than people who have knowledge in only one subject . First , it is better to know about many subjects in relationship than to be enclosed in only one . We can talk about everything , that makes us more interesting to people . Nowadays , it is really important to keep good relations in our society . Then , someone who knows about a lot of things can serve the others by helping them . I know someone who knows about quite a lot of things , and is able to help his friends due to his knowledge .  However , someone who only has broad knowledge may be disturbed at a point . He may not be able someday to continue a conversation and to be able to expose his ideas because he would need to have deeper knowledges about the subject . That 's why someone who has only broad knowledge of many subjects can be at some point disadvantaged .  Someone who is specialized in only one specific subject can certainly speaks and work on something which is relative to his specialization . Nevertheless , he would also be disadvantaged if he is faced to something that is not his subject . He would then feel unuseful to the conversation or work project . This person may seem also less interesting to the others than the person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because of his lack of knowledge of other subjects .  To conclude , a person who has broad knowledge about many subjects may be more interesting , but he could unfortunatly be disadvantaged because of his broad knowledge .  I think that someone with broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better thant someone specialei	FRE
I agree with the statement which say that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . trying new things helps in giving new experiences . developing ones knowledge and personality and creating sense of creativity . On the other hand , only doing what we alraedy know how to do kill the creativity and create sense of boring .  Fisrt , successful people try new things because that will help them to have new experiences with new things . taking risks will help inopen the minds and open new doors , The more the one try , the more he became experienced and will qualified .  Second , successful person try new things and take risks because that will help them to improve their knowledge and develop their personality . Trying new things will make the person more knowledgable in many areas becuase he had been going through many areas and cover many topics . Moreover trying new thing will help in developing your characterstics because going throug many situations will give you more enperience about how to deal with differant people and differant situations .  Thirdly , Trying new things and taking risks will help you in creating sense of creativity which is very important to your pschological development . Trying new thing will keep you awy from boring and add new flavor to you life .  To conclude , I strongly agree with the statement which say that successful people try new things and take risks . that help them in giving new experieces , de	ARA
i strongly agree with the statement saying that the young people enjoy life more than older people , yes ; because they have the time , the energy and the ability to do that . young people looking for the life from defferant view , they have clear mind and not that much responsablities and concerns .  the young people looking for some thing make them happy and they try to find out what is the ejoyable things on the life and they will do it , when they have as example a brand new car you find them spend a long time driving this car and going trips with the friends and they will satisfied with the complements about having like this car .  on the other hand when you looking for the older people you will find them busy with the life concers and families issues if they have a family , also they do n't have a lot of time to spend in fun , mainly you find them concern about defferant issues like politics or build up good future for their kids , but some of older people whom thinking about the vacation is important as much as the work and mony important , so they always have the time to enjoy their live and ivest some time for entertainment and recreations .  as a conclusion i think the young people more able to enjoy their live because they are still young and they are looking for the coming days with a bright future but as i said befor the older people can enjoy the live as if the young do because they have experiance and they can organize their life obviously better than the young people .

To have a strong knowledge of many academic subject is excellent way to success . First , to know a wide number of subjects can be useful to understand several situations that need backgrown in different fields . For instance , there are many interdiciplinate fields , such as Biophysics , Biomedical Engineering , which need to have knowledge in two or more specific subjects to understand Second , the knowlegde of many subjects can provide the advantages of to make analogies . It is possible , for example , to explain the Cardiovascular System with concept of Dynamics of Fluids that is a subject of Physics . With more knowed subject it more clear to understand new concepts and make analogies with concepts have been known in the past .  Third , it is important when to pursue a work position to have much knowledge in several academic subjects because the salary will be higher . People who have degrees in different subjects can obtain better positions and higher incomes than people who just know one subject .  Finally , the importance of several knowledges can be summarized in to understand different fields which need a strong backgrown like the interdiciplinate sciencs , to make analogies with knowed concepts and to obtain better work positions .

In my opinion , for a student , it 's far more important to understand ideas and concepts than learn facts . In the procedure of teaching there are two conponments to establish : the fact of learning itself and the interpretation the student may give it to .  At first , a student has to learn the basis of a subject . The teacher 's job is to give him as many information as he can . These informations have to be general . A teacher is not an amateur ( as he has already learned the subject before ) so he has already his on point of view . The teacher is just here to give general informations and in any case he could influence the students ' mind . So learning facts is too tuned on theory and not in practice .  Then , once the student knows the basis , the general facts , he has to go further from the given-informations by himself , in order to understand all the specifics of the subject . I think that understanding ideas and concepts is something personal . It is something made by oneself . Nobody would never has the same interpretation of ideas . It depends on the experiences of the student and its possible story or link to a subject .  For example , in a theorical course of law , the teacher can teach students the evolution of something in particular like the stance of society with the homosexual marriages . But I think is for more important for the students to understand how this stance has emerged and learn all the discourse of both of the people for or against it . thus , the student can make his own opinion even if it is not the same as the majority of the population .

I agree with this statement partially ; because although we have to explore new areas where to pursue success , it is almost obligatory to gain a high level of expertise to attain it .  I should be admitted that there are several good reasons for trying new things . First of all , it is difficult to be successful in an already developed field . People in that field have been specializing and putting their effort and energy for a longtime . For example , the technics for shoe = making is already very wel established and people in this sector know very well how to produce high quality shoes for low costs . Secondly , the change is unavoidable in virtually all the areas of human activity and people not taking any risks for exploring new things are deemed to be surpassed by the '' risk = takers '' . Sticking to the same example , a person using leather as the raw material for making shoes and not willing to learn about how to use other potentially useful material , would one day have to retire . Maybe the most important reason for trying new things is the potential of generating synergy between what we already know and wwhat we will explore : the world is divided into '' things '' artificially by the humans and we can always find fruitful relations between one '' thing '' that we already know and another one that we get to know .  On the other hand , history is also full of famous people who caught the success via persevering in a well = defined field , from army commanders to artists to shoemakers and athletes . The reason is that in any given area , there are many very talented people trying to be the number one ; through improving their related skills and also via obtaining relevant knowledge both of which require long periods of hard work . So the definitoin of success is always pushed furhter in terms of required perfection .  Although the first man on the earth had naturally to try new thinghs he also had to improve on his skills for not failing = if he had not ; we would not be here . There are always new areas potentially very useful for the humanity to explore . But the process of exploration requierd l	TUR
It is often said that there will be no more traffic-jam in the future . Scientists have been developing a flying car and bigger and faster public transportation vehicle will be developed . Howevere , I formly disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in next twenty years . There will be more population than today and there will be many barriers to use those technologies actually .  To begin with , growing the number of population will make the world more complicated and complex and each person will have own car . Compared with the past , it is true that we have a lot more cars nowadays than the past . For example , in Seoul , Korea , three of ten had a own car even ten yeas ago . How about now ? The percentage of possesion is almost same with the past . However , the number of cars is five times more than 1990s ' .  In addition , twenty years are not enough time to develop some new technology and actuallly use it . The government have tried to make new subway system and monorail system within ten years , but the thing was already twenty years ago . There is no any changes and they have still been planning . For example , one of the experts from the government said last week , they were planning to adapt new system for aircraft within five years . The essay for the next day , however , criticized that the government should finish the Airforce-military system changing plan which had not been finished for ages . Also , it said , `` no more people in this country believe the government ! ''  In conclusion , we all hope that a fewer cars is in the world in the future . It should be replaced by the great public transportation , such as subway and buses . Also , government should make the cost of flights much cheaper than now . However , I do not agree with that there will be a fewer cars in use than now in the next twenty years with all these reasons .	KOR
Every year , millions of travelers , everywhere in the world travel . From a rich business man taking his wife on vacation to a kid and his bundle in a hurry to explore the planet . A trip in an unknown location needs to be prepared obviously . .. and a tour guide is always ready to take the group to visit the local wonders . But is it the best way to travel ?  I personnaly disagree with this statement , I think it deprives us from the spontaneous and adventurous aspect of a trip .  When I travel , usually to unknow countries with my friends and family , it is of course to have a good time and see odd sights that i may not have the chance to see again . But mostly i like the feeling of freedom that i get : I can go anywhere anytime . But being led by a travel guide kind of takes that aspect away : following an exact map and program of the visit . .. and many times the guide is n't a personal guide , for that you have to follow others to see things that you did n't even want to see in the first place . A personal experience : during a guided tour of Paris , few years back , i was stuck ( so to speek ) in a Art exhibition that i did not plan to attend . But since i had no car , and no money for a cab . .. i was obligated to stay with the group , being bored out of my mind .  More then that , of course staying in a nice hotel with a minibar full of drinks is nice , but i also love backpacking : going from place to place without a perfectly planned trip , staying at hostels , without the feeling that i have to follow the map exactly as planned . In that case being led by a tour guide would be denying the whole definition of adventurous exiting backpacking .  To conclude , i would like to say that following a group led by a tour guide is a great way to explore the city , you get to see all the important sights , but it might not be fit for some people such as me who enjoy adrenaline boosts .

I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . Whether the advertisement one sees is through a television or a magazine , this particular individual is bound to receive some sort of effect upon the immediate exposure . This exposure can be explained in two interesting ways . One is explained via visual effect and the other is through the means of incorporating one 's psychological effect .  As we all know , in order to advertise a certain product , excessive visual luring is to be expected from the viewers . The makers of these advertisements will try in every conceivable way to present their products at its finest . This is where the visual effect comes in . There will be many trial and error and thorough , various steps will also be required in order to complete one final advertisement before they are presented in the buyers ' eyes . When that item is then advertised , the viewers will inevitably be tricked and allusioned to see beyond the actual practicality and state of that particular item .  The second effect , the psychological one derives from the audience 's point of view . Sometimes the products being advertised in the media just looks nice , glamorous and even useful simply because they are unattainable . At times that particular item may be too costly that it is one 's out of budget . This explains our natural human instinct to need and want what we can not have . Therefore , the hope to be able to possess a certain product - perhaps in the near future or never at all - will push your desire to purchse that product even more . Hence , when a buyer does not conveniently have the item at hand while seeing the advertisement , it is only natural to make that particular item seem much better than they really are .  To conclude , the reasons whether they are external or internal , bring the same result to the viewers of these advertisement . They are not necessarily good or bad but the need to control one 's perception is important in deciding if that reason is valid . The viewers , the buyers must therefore reason and fight for what is real and what is not . Sometime it is simply our mind that tricks us into buying . This is when you realize you 've made the wrong decision .	KOR
i agree with the statement which is given to me . because tavelling with the group make me to share more things with different peoplewho wre in the group . travelling in a group with guide will make me to know the new placs which ihd never visited before . guide will explain the entire information about the place . travelling in group make more advantages becuse if the information about a place is not known to the guide i will try to know the information with my colleagues who are in the group . tour guide will probably have a clear idea of which place is mare important than those of others . if we are having a little time to explore new places in the country it is suitable to take an idea from the tour guide . travelling in a group makes me more enthusiatic to know the new things . if i had visited the place early i will try to explain the place i had visited . if iwill travell in a group it will keep me away from the lazyness . i will try to know the different cultures that exist in a country and the ideas of different people how they are thinking . whether they are thinking in a positive manner or in a negative manner . travelling in agroup makes me more attention and concentration that i had . people with inthe group makes me more enjoyable while travelling . it will release my tensions and problems . the travelling with the group maske me easy to travell because it will not let me know how much time i travelled . i can travellmore long distances with the group .

Creativity and innovaton is ongoing concern of the bussiness entities . Recent activities such as new programs which aims to people use their creativity in the projects . Trying alternatives and gaining new persepective will be efficient in reducing the risk of failing by progressing potential to produce solution for problems . Steady knowledge is important to maintain the status quo so that person does not tka risk in order to change the situation .  Initially , people who are supervising an project have to see situation from many aspects . How is is to be acchieved is directly correlated with how much they are experienced . the only way of increasing the experience is to try new alternatives and take risk for creating a new solution . Making observation can not be efficient as applying it and gaining experince .  In addition , in daily life , people face with new people and new situations which are not identical to each other . In any unwanted case , all of the previous knowledge can be helpful to some extent . if is considered as problem with many unknowns , changing any unknown will directly effect the result . As in our immune system , our body will response the invading pathogens more powerful in subsequent exposures than the first one .  Beyond these , human beings sometimes can be on pursuit of new tastes in order to renew their lives and refresh their souls . life consisting of eating and sleeping is not worth living so that how many years you lived can not be as important how you lived . People who are afraid of taking risk for adding up their lives in fact do not want to violate their identities . Therefore they continue to go in the way which they know well . however , there should be differences between human beings and plants in order to put them into other group .

I strongly agree with this statement . Let me explain why . We live in the era of information and technology . Our everyday life is sorrounded by this fact : computers and Internet , television , cinema . .. Enterprises take benefit from this new way of obtaining information , and settle their advertisements everywhere . We can see publicity on the streets ( for example bus stops ) , on the Internet ( while we surf the net , many different advertisements will show up ) , in the cinema ( films usually contain hidden references to products ) ... But the main way enterprises expose their products is television .  Most of the population has a TV at home , or at least , has access to it in the neighbourhood or at school . .. Who does n't watch television ? A person that might admit not watching it would be treated as an alien or something similar . Publicity in television is the main support of a TV channel : enterprises pay large amounts of money to have a space after a program , so they can show their products .  And what about the products showed on the television ? Well , as we can daily see , all types of items are anounced : cars , perfums , films , drinks , food . .. But are these products exposed from an objective point of view ? No , I do n't think so . Publicity experts design the advertisements in a way it will call the spectator 's attention , but not because of the products nature , instead of that , they will talk about its effects , about the feelings or impressions you will experience if you buy it or use it . Have you ever seen a `` high quality '' perfum advertisement ? This publicity will not refer to the way the essence is made , no , this advertisement will talk about the effect it might have in the person and all the people that sorrounds that person . For instance : the perfum will make you feel fresh ; or make all the men fall in love with you ; or make you the sexiest girl in the city ; or even compare the perfum 's effect with the great pleasures in life ! The thing is that we do n't realise this is n't true until we buy the product , and then , it 's already too late . So finally we conclude , as the statement says , that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	SPA
Very few people in France think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic than to specialise in one specifice subject . Indead , they think that you need to go through all the details of a specific field if you want to be efficient . Is that true or not ?  I do n't agree with such a prejudice . On the contrary , I think the more you know , the more efficient you are . For example , if someone wants to work in a library , will he be more efficient if he knows everything about books , publishing and printing ? I do n't think so . I think he will be more efficient if he knows about different things such as history , anthropology , philosophy , litterature or science . Practice can give you all technical knowledge but it will never replace broad knowledge provided by schools and universities .  The second reason why I think a broad knowledge is important in our society is that people who have broad knowledge are more flexible . They are able to switch from one field to another . In other words , they are what I would call ` complete persons ' . The can adapt themselves to every change . For example , you can be a banker today and become a manager tomorrow .  My last point is about my political vision of a modern society : I think that a good citizen needs to have a broad knowledge of all academic subjects in order to make good choices . Reality is complex : if you want to understand what is happening in your contry and in the whole world you need to have a solid knowledge in different fields such as geography , economy or technology .  To conclude about this subject , I would say that the british ideal of the ` gentleman ' who knows about all aspects of human things continues to be important in our modern world .	FRE
I agree , because the advertisement exagerate the efficiency or quality of the product sounds like a salesman in the shop . The marketing in some many brands are aggresive that it is because , they want to compete with others and then show how are the brand is better than the others . Example of that is the Walt Disney 's Company Over the year we saw many commercial announcements in television , internet , movies and mailing letters , they bombarding to us with this promotions over and over again but in some many ways they sellit a `` dream may come true '' but it is not true when you dedide to start a vacation in Walt Disney the do n't tell you about the long lines in the sun waiting for the attractions or waiting for eat in restaurants . This is sort of a kind of huge mistake when the advertisement capture our attention and became more attractive that the reality . This is an example so how the people is enchanted for some advertisement and the reality is other when arrive to `` Walt Disney '' . Other advertisements just like food or diets show the specific people achieve their goals when entering to this plan , but the reality is other , because they never tell you how much is cost when you became interested in that program , the reality is they manipulate the statistics and sold dreams and stole money for the customers , who failed to achieve that goal . In my opinion the people need to be more wisely when they attracted and impressed with an advertisement , just because they wants your money and not your needs or satisfaction that you want . That why they called marketing .	SPA
Nowadays , due to the fact that life time is becoming longer for all human beings , everyone can enjoy life in each moment . However , I do think that young people are still more welling to afford life in a more enjoyable manner than older people do . So , I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than younger people do . In my essay , I will provide some resons that make my agreeing with that statement .  The first reson why young people are able to enjoy life more that older peole are , is that , as they are young , they have a lot of experinces to do , Young peolple may wish to experince emotions that they have never tried before because of their age . They might like to have a family , and so they try al they can to find a good partner , enjoying any occasion they will have inorder to reach taht aim . Moreover , they wold like to experince works . They wold like to enjoy the jobs that they eventually find and they will try to apprecite all the aspects of them , as they rapresent their first experince in the labour market .  Younger people might enjoy life more than the ealderlies , because , as they are young , they have more energies to afford life itself . On the contrary of old people , young people enjoy sports , such as fotball , or basketball , which are an essentail part of life , and which request a lot of energies that older people , in general does not have . Furthermore , thanks to the energies that young people have because of thei age , they have more opportunity than older peole to make fanny and relaxing things , suchs as trips or partys , which are so helpful in order to enjoy life .  To coclude , I do think that young people enjoy life more than old people do , because of the experinces they wolu like to try in their future , and because of the energies they allowed them to exploit the most enjoiable aspects of life .  job	ITA
I will explain why I disagree with the statement that in twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .  To start with as time goes by more cars are being produced and sold allover the world . This trend can be attributed to different factors , such as the world 's population growth or the lower cost of vehicles that leads to higher affordability for the demand .  The population keeps growing as I mentioned and for this reason more people are willing to buy cars . Also , as also mentioned above , low cost of production given by modern technologies and new materials allows more people to buy a car .  Another reason that makes more people willing to get a car is given by the improvement of the transportation system pretty much allover the world . We see big highways and roads being built every day so that more places in the world become better connected to each other .  There are many countries , such as Italy for example , where the public transports system is not fully developed , for this reason a growing number of people prefers to have its own car rather than to rely on a way to travel that is not as efficient .  A psychological reason also explains why more cars will be seen in twenty years from now than today ; the society tends to be very individualistic and less social than it used to be . For this reason more people prefer to be independente when they get around and the car becomes their own shell .  Cars can not be replaced simply because people need them to go to work , to travel , to see places in complete freedom ; sometimes peole just want to get the pleasure of driving them and feel a sort of freedom .  Because of all the above reasons I believe more cars will be produced and sold in the future , therefore in twenty years from now we will see more cars than today , not fewer .	ITA
In mordern society , students always face the dillemma that which one is more important between understanding ideas and learning facts . This problem is the much debated one in that it affects everyone in their daily life . Some people prefer the first one to another and others have on opinions about it . Before rending my opinion , i think it is necessary to take a galance of the argurments from both the sides .  It si quite easy for average people to choose learning facts because the several obvious reasons that learning facts is more interesting , is easier and so on . Although learning facts has some advantages , it also has many drawbacks such as you don not understand it deeply . Therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that learning facts is always better than unerstanding ideas . What is more , the innate quality of understanding ideas , unfortunally , is ofter \ n underestimated ; in other words , if you notice the invisable benefits of understanding ideas , you can understand it more deeply . Here I want to explain a few of the most important reasons .  It is the ability to think that is the first aspect of understanding ideas that people view profoundly . To illustate this , there is an appropriate example that is very persuasive . My parents are professors , so they usually teach me systematically to understand ideas and put this on the prist place since I was a kid . As the times going on , I gradually become a person with ability to think . And this is very useful to me because this ability makes me more creative .  Besides , the further reason why I advocate this is because that it is widely acknowledged that interesting is an indispensable part to the students ' studing and this issue is becoming a certain concern to many experts . To me , I think understanding ideas is more interesting than learning facts . They are more attractive and fascinating  Finally , I think understanding ideas is easier for students to understand . Because facts could be differently in many conditions and they might influenced or change due to other factors . In contrast , understaning ideas is more straight , is better for the students who don not have good intellecgence to learn .  Taking into all these factor in to accounts , we may safely arrive at the conclusion that understanding ideas is more important for students and it is more desire us to endeavor and we also could desire a special fulfillment and pleasure	CHI
The big exchange  through the huge use of planes now adays I start to feel that the cars will be history .  in spite of the large number of cars , the planes numbers in growing . since the first flight over the ocian people began to love the plane speed and to save times in travels .  in planes the people do n't get tired of driving or even make an accedent which usually found in cars .  also planes can transport a large quantity of things and in no time , and that we really miss in cars .  and the big reason that in the air there are no traffic jams ( at least until now ) .  all of the reasons above will make the people think of travel in planes , or even own thier private plane which is ussually smaller then the ordinary planes .  with all these benefits , the people still feeling worried about traveling in plans instead of cars . Since 11/9 people began to think of the worst thing can happen to them which is kidnapping , but this feeling begins to be history in now adays .  the planes accedents are much smaller in number than accedents with cars which make the people feeling comfortable .  I thing in 20 years the airports will be more and more the planes on the other hand will develop and pilots schools will be opened to ordinary peoples . many shapes and models of planes will appear , many companies will exchange thier prouduction of ars into planes for example : i think we will see a nice GMC plane or even a toyota plane ...  there will be also small airfield near almost every street .  the use of car will be like riding horses now ! and the most exiting thing is to have your own plane , airport and passengers .  there will be a taxi planes  and that what i call it : THE BIG EXCHANGE	ARA
In modern capitalist society , advertisements are a natural part of life . In this situation , I believe that it is all but inevitable that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  The fundamental reason is that modern consumerism has made it necessary for companies to advertise their products simply because there are more goods than are necessary . Before the advent of mass production and mass consumption , the situation was vice versa : there were probably fewer goods than are necessary . Naturally , therefore , producers did not need to advertise at all . But in today 's society , because of the tremendous advance of technology , it is possible to churn out unnecessary commodities produced mainly , or perhaps only , to gain profits by selling them . As a result , producers are forced to make their products look much better than they really are so that they will be able to sell them out .  Another significant reason why advertisers exaggrate the value of their products is people 's expectation to have newer and `` better '' things . In order to keep up with these consumers ' demand , companies are compelled not only to make new , slightly-upgraded products all the time but also to make the small improvement as impressive . The case in point is the computer industry . PC makers change their models three or four times a year even though the improvement is minor . Because people expect this and because all the other competitors do so , a PC maker can not afford to continue to sell a PC first put on the market a year ago . As a result , it is necessary for PC makers to make their products look signficantly better than their previous models by , for example , changing their looks although the content is not much different .  In conclustion , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for two reasons . Modern consumerism has made it necessary , and as a result , people are accustomed to have `` better '' products , which forces producers to exaggerate minor improvements . It would be impossible to change this situation , and , therefore , consumers need to be wise enough not to be deceived by advertisements .	JPN
No i do not entirly agree on the statement that group travel led by a tour guide is the best way to travel due to numerous reasons  i have gone to many countries both in a group with my parents and alone , in my experince the best time i had was with a group of teenagers my age in Usa because we were all the same age and of diffrent backgrounds , but it wasn ' entirly like a vacation where you had your peice of mind , and complete freedom to they ways you wanted to enjoy your time . Rather than waking up at 6 in the morning and going accordiong to set guidelines made by the tour guide i would chose to roam the place alone , discovering numerous places on my own and taking the vacation as an adventure .  Altough moving in a group can be fun , but i belive going with a small group of maybe about 2 or 3 freinds that think alike is a better option and even though going with a huge group is amazing fun , the tour guide is what spoils all the fun . tour guides usually have the whole vacation planned out with set timmings making the holiday seem like another school day where you have a worked up schedule to follow .  therefore in my opnion the best way to travel would definatly be in a group but without a tour guide , because then you get the freedom to do you want and the liberty to make you own dicisions rather than following a tour guide . but if the tour guide is another person similar to the group your traveling in and knows the place well the tour could defintly be the best ones . But going to the himalays for adventure with a tour guide would defenitly kill the adventorus feeling that could be achived by going alone .  therefore the statemnt has its pros and cons dependiong on your tour guide , the group and the situation . but if all the three are perfect then the statment is defenitly justified .

I partially agree with this statement . I think that having a broad and wide knowledge is a really good thing : if you are open minded and can discuss about many topics , you can get many opportunities , and you can also have more immunity to market variations . For instance , in case of macro-economic problems in a certain productive area , you can be able to change your work more freely , and more rapidly respect to the ones which are very deeply specialized . Otherwise , workers ( and here I refere also to managers , and people who have great responsabilities ) also need to be specialized in a certain field . According to my opinion and to my knowledge , today the market needs people who are specialized , but also needs people who can share their knowledge with their colleagues , in order to obtain revenues by sinergy and cooperation practices ; for this reason I think that while you are a student you need to widen as much as possible the spectrum of you knowlegde , investigating as many fields as possible ; according to me , it is reasonable to improve a specific tecnical ability just after finishing your studies ( or during the last year of your academic career ) ; behaving in such a way , you could have both the basic wide knowledge to effort changes , and also the specialization , which could make you the best worker in a certain field at a certain time and in a certain region . For example , workers with a low istruction level , may have many problems in case of changes in the strategy of their company , or ( and this is a more dramatical problem for workers involved in the process ) in case of market revolutions , which make a certain product obsolete , or generate the so called `` killers applications '' . So , in order to be an attractive worker for the labour market , you need to specialize your knowledge , but in order to minimize risks , and to avoid market changes , you have to widen your knowledge ; you also need to improve your capabilities and knowledge after you have finished your studies : this is the so called `` life long learning '' , which I believe is the best model in modern society .

It is important to know both the ideas and concepts as well as the facts . Of cource the ideas of a topic or a problem makes it easier to understand and to remember it but it takes much longer to be taught this concepts . So sometimes it is easier to learn only facts even if they are dry and boring . It depends on what you have to do with the information , wether if you have to write an assey about that or if it is just for your own general knowledge . To know facts is sometimes important when you are talking to or discussing with other people . To show them in a short time that you have a big knowledge about different subjects , you will need facts .  To come back to the ideas and concepts I can say that if you have a big interest in something it is not enough just to know about the facts . Also for yourself you want to know more and understand the whole thing . If you have exams in this topic , it is much easier to answer the asked questions because you have the background .  For myself I prefer to learn ideas and concepts . I am studying and at the university it is very important to understand the problem . The exams are very difficult and hard . So if you are not prepared and only know the facts , you are lost . But sometimes if I read the newspaper or watch TV , I try to remember short facts . Usually I do not have the time to read about every topic too long so I just remember the most important things . After that I know what other people are talking about , not at all but I can understand the problem or topic because of the learned facts . To sumerize I would say that ideas and concepts are important to know when it is your cource or work . But facts are good to know for social relations .	GER
I believe that people who take risks are successful and smatter as well because life is all on taking risk especially on todays society were its all about the compitition . For example if the college admission person sees an application with someone who has done what every else has done as in requirements they will be dissapointed with the student . When they see someone who has done things that have never done before they will only not be impress but they will take a chance as well . If you already know how to do a expirement you should try to improve it by taking a risk and actually doing something much defferent . Also if you want to be the owner of a restaurant and you really want this to be the best selling retaurant and you are diciding where there you name the place a name of a well known chain of restaurant or you could take a chance and find originality by naming it something thing else . If you become successful that way you will feel proud of your creativity and if you do n't become so successful at list you will feel proud that you failed with your own idea . This is what makes you defferent from someone else originality a risk take is what succeds in life . Knowing how to do something is one step closer to taking a risk and being more success then you were when you found out you knew how to do something . The next step is making it original and being proud of the possitive results or negetive in some cases . Being a brain cancer survivor has taught me that taking risks in your life is the best way to live life . I took some risks in the hospital and know here I am being successful .	SPA
We do not have any proof about this statement and so we can say many different things . When I talk to my father and we are involved in traffic he carries on saying that he when was a teen there was not all this mess . Streets were not full of cars because there was only one car per family . Now everything has changed . First of all every year we hear about statistic investigations that give us a completely different point : the number of cars is increasing . This may be caused by the improving of our wealth conditions . When my father was young Italy was a poor country and it was just at the beginning of its transformation in a modern country . So the actual situation does not seem to sustain the statement .  There is however some other considerations that we can do . Our development can not be sustained by our planet . Our supplies of oil are getting fewer and fewer and we have not found valid alternative powers to substitute oil by now . There is hydrogen but it is more expensive . At the same time electrical engines do not have the same performances of the actual engines . So if for example hydrogen will be our only alterntive it will probably be impossible for a family to have enough money to pay more than one car with hydrogen as propeller .  The other thing that can influence the number of cars is the policy of our governments . As I have already mentioned , traffic is increasing more and more every year . But it will not be always possible to build new streets and new routes . There will be a limit . This fact can be already seen in the choices of some important cities . To get in London with our car we must pay a ticket . Also Milan is going to adopte similar decisions . So perhaps there will be a strong development of public transports .  Instead some countries have already found different alternatives . Netherlands for example is the country where there is the highest number of bicicles in the world . If you walk around the streets of Amsterdam , you will see bicicles everywhere . Even in front of bars , megastores and fastfoods . But this result is related to the choice of the government of building streets for bicicles . So the politicians have encouraged people to lock their cars in their garage .  In the end , I do not see the possibility of a spontaneus reduction of the number of cars . There are too many interests often related to the oil industry and to the factories that build cars . They are often important parts of our economy and the governments do not want to damage them . But they will be probably obliged with us to change our life style when the situation will get unsustainable .	ITA
I 'm agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people . The young are happier , have more energy , and do n't think to much in the consecuenses of an action . Young people like to enjoy life , going to the movies , beaches , parties , going to ride bike , traveling , listening to the music , dancing and a lot of more activities . They want to be happy . Old people usually have less energy to do a lot of things than the young peolple can do . When you are old may be your healt is not the same and you has to expend time going to the doctors , therapy , going to the farmacy for medicines and be at home for more time whith responsabilities to do , work , grandchildrens to take care . You think more is you want to going to a place . Young people and old people have a different way to think about live , resposabilitis and having fun . Old people are more conservatives . Most of young people just think in having fun whith their friends and most of the old people just think about work or rest .	SPA
Many people would be propose that students are understanded ideas and concepts more siginificant than they are learned the facts . I can hardly agree with . The students learn facts are more beneficial for them .  First of all , text raraly measures a student 's social ability , a student 's ability to communicate , and a student 's ability to successiful integrate into the world . In contrast , If students are learnd facts , they can have these qualities more easily .  Besides , if the students are going to successful in today 's society , only understand the ideas and concepts is not enough . They learn facts lead to them to become a successful person . For example , it is rare that one finds stimulating employment that does not requir at least a basic on computer . If student is learned the skill of computer , they will be more well-liked .  Last but not least , Learning the facts allows the students become well-developed adluts . If the students only understand the ideas and concepts , they will be a mean-spirited person .  In conclusion , from my perspective , learning facts is more momentous than understanding ideas and concepts .	CHI
No one would be able to stay in a specific country fopr the rest of his life . Lets assume that theres some1 donst want to travel and leave his country , well i think hes lifeless and he doesnt wanna enjoy the taste of traveling and life . Its not neccessary to travel in a group led by a tour guide , traveling alone or with a couple of friends is much adventorous as long as u dont cross the limits of adventure . A trip would make a person learn more about other contries , different cultures and experience hard times a normal person would gop through . Travelling alone would provide a person with a chance to stand up n take responsibility of himself . Travbeling alone would provide a person with a precious oppurtunity to plan , manage , and learn more about the obsticles hes going to face during life time . Life is not all about joy and pleasure it is mainly to experience the rough times a person would go through .	ARA
In my opinion i disagree with the topic about most advertisements make products seem much better than really they are . In this new global world and era the companies try to reach so many people around world by the use of technology . But it can be sometimes harmful for the consumers who do not pay attention .  Firsty of all there are too many ways to attract consumers about the product . We can use internet , tv , radios , by giving advertisements . All of them are effective . by using a famous footballer or model you can increase the popularity of the product . On the other hand , the companies use cameras and light illusions to show the product more attractive . Also this method can be used for showing the big one as a little and the slow one as a huge one . An addition to this mechanisms the advertisment given on tvs or internet are repeated so many times in order to persuade and convice the consumers . this made pressure on the consumers to try the product . the last factor for me to attract the consumers about the product is its price . As we know if a product is cheap we always think that it is the best suitable one for us . It i a quite wrong stetement in fact . Thus the companies know this situation and use it as a most well known weapon .  In spite of the stated facts below , there are also some advertisement reclects the obvious and fair appearance and usage of a product . In such kind of situation we can try to companies mark on it . For example some marks like bmw , general electrics , lcw are most well known producers so we can trust their product also advirtisements .  Consequently , in our global and technologic world all companies try to take a role in world trade and make much more money . Furthermore we can say thet worlds management is related with some big companies . So the smaller ones try to be in this huge budget . And also they can do everything to get this even they force the countries to begin a war . Attractive products to convince people are an easy piece of cake for them .	TUR
Yes I Agree that most advertisement make products better than they really are . Allready advertisement to focus to buy and consumer products . way of reaching their purpose is makin to admire consumer . So products must be attractive and services to other sense of consumer . Deemands must creative by advertisement .  The advertisement is one of them marketing tools . It is n't given direct message by advertisement they are general , imagination , colourful and attractive . It mus n't be border . Advertisements are serviced 6 sense of human to creative demands .  For example orenge juise advertisements , All ages of people could be a product . Messages might be power , enegy , sex , dream , healty , even as like medicine . Even pictures of nice real oranges and more colourfull but its integreds sugar , water , fruit parfums , glikos , fruit nectar etc . . May be they will be enjoyable atmosfer in back ground of the advertsiement for example a young people party . That could be message sex , romance etc . ..  So succesefull advertisement will be determined by rate of cunsomer . So how much sperate of people , earns profits , addvalue are important points of making advertisement that Products are seem better than they really are .	TUR
It is more important for students to understand ideas and cocnepts than it is for them to learn , i agree with this because it is important for every student to understand anything rather than learning it , the student can continue the path of the knowledge and can get more informations to confirm that the student understood it before learning the fact .  A student is a human being so he cant skip the main ideas of understanding and concepts of the study , with out understanding the student would get struggled and cant learn the facts clearily , understanding the study in steps helps a lot because it avoids all the mistakes that a student can make .  Understanding ideas and concepts is a must for all student 's , but it has to be done in steps before learning it directly , the student can learn the facts easily after understanding it , schools are located to give the student a breif exlanation of how it 's done and how to understand the ideas before analysing them and learning the facts of it .  Colleges in different administrations and majors give the student a chance for understanding the ideas of the study that student is in , schools are located to give the understanding to the student , after that the student when is graduated from school goes to the college and would be ready to learn the facts because the student would be ready , but it 's not very important for the student to learn the fact than understanding the ideas and concepts .  The main idea of the essay is for any student in anywere in the world should understand the ideas and concepts before thinking about learning the facts because understanding the ideas and cocepts gives the student a chance to know the subject .

I agree with this speech young people nowadays do not give time to helping their communities . the life is changed from the past I mean every things became faster and faster in this life . everyone busy with his own life .  first of all , the young people are busy wirh their study and their own life . the young people in the past , they do not warried about their study . however , now they worry alot for they study and they want to be something in their sociuty .  Next , young people have alot of thing want to do . For example , they want to enjoy in their free time with their friends . They want to go to the mall or visit some best friends . On other hand , in the past they have alot of time to help their communities .  Finally , the year after the year the young people will be more busy than now because of the technology which develope year after year and the life will be more difficult . I think the young people should orginize their time in this cause they can do want they want . Also , they can help their communties .	ARA
In order to answer to this question it may be useful to spread my idea from the definition of the concept of `` community '' to the concept of `` responsability '' . But I think this will take me a lot of time and . .. space , in terms of words to be written . However , I think that the statement reported in the left frame of this window is to be validated as well as no generalization can be done about something , since what we state is just refered to our personal experience . \ Starting from this foundamental point that structures my idea on such a topic , I can clearly say that I do not ( completely ) agree with what is stated . As a matter of fact there are young people who give enough time - sometimes , TOO time - for helping community , and there are on the contrary young people who do not want to be involved in this fact . I think that nowadays the importance given to a generic `` job '' ( not the one we referred to as the `` money-bringer '' process , but the one of something a person can do for a reason or for another ) depends on the social , cultural and political environment in which that job is processed . As a matter of fact I think that it is true that young people have different aims in their life , but it is also true that in one way or another those people could be helping community even if they do n't know they are .  What I am stressing is the idea that no one can say with no doubt that a generic person P is making well for the community instead of a person Q who is not doing well . I think that this has to be referred from situation to situation and no generalization can be used , in any way .  However I can see , from my personal experience within my family , that that thing years ago guided young people to help community , for example helping old people or people with some disease etc. , is no longer present nowadays : I refer to a mind condition , i.e. SPIRITUAL SUPPORT , THINKING OF OTHERS ( in Italian we call it ALTRUISMO ) ... but nowadays we look at CONVENIENCE , mainly ( I underline another time , NOT ALWAYS ) . Convenience is probably the main disease oppressing humanity because convenience makes us do something just for the `` do ut des '' criterion , but this is not always the right thing to do . This can be found in every field : at work , at school , in sports ( I live in Italy . .. ) . In conclusion I can remark what I just read in this few lines : no matter what you work for or you work in , no matter what people say to you and what people think about you ( in a rational way , obviously ) , just do what you did for so long , and you will help your community as much as you can . ..

In a world filled with knowledge and a variety of educational lines , one has a great number of subjects to choose from . It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one particular subject .  A prospective student may want to pursue his career learning only the subjects he requires . An architect , for example , would want to study Physics and Mathematics , as subjects like these help him in his field . Though English literature and environmental sciences are not required in his field , they pass on some principles that would help him through life 's race . A look into the environment may help him to select different types of material to be used in construction , so as to keep the environment safe . After his education , he would come out more knowledgable .  During one 's schooling , one is exposed to a variety of subjects like History and Geography . Did you ever come across this time when you wonder - `` Why ? What use is this going to be to me in the future ? Will the knowledge of what happened to my country a thousand years ago help me in the future ? 20 years later , will anyone ask me how high Mt . Everest is ? '' . Though this information may seem useless at that age , after progressing through life 's obstacles , one realizes that the knowledge one had gained by studying such subjects is very precious and valuable . We now remember that Mt . Everest is 8997 Metres high and is going higher every year . It gives us a sense of superiority and pleasure that we , after so many years , remember such tiny details .  Specializing in one specific subject may give the student more time to understand the subject and achieve perfection . Specializing may give one an edge over others . But when we emerge into society , ready to make a difference to our lives , the lives of others , or the world as a whole , we realize that a broader knowledge of subjects is better than specializing in one subject . With knowledge comes power , and with power comes responsibility . It is our responsibility to make this world a better place .	HIN
The statement asserts that understanding ideas and concepts is more important learning facts .  Before we move on to judge the merit of the assertion lets try to differentiate between `` Ideas and concepts '' and `` facts '' .  Ideas and concepts represent the fundamental `` line of thought '' or `` logical progression '' behind any phenomenon . For example different cultures use kinship nomenclatures e.g. Uncle , father , mother etc. in order to express not just natural relationship , but also social relationship , status , power equation , economic situation etc .  On the other hand , `` Facts '' represent the `` hard examples '' or `` expressions '' which can be immediately placed in their context and are self explanatory . For example , Uncle is term used for father 's or mother 's brother . But in many cultures uncle is also a term used for any significantly older male , even if no biological relationship exists .  What it essentially means is that it is very difficult to understand `` ideas and concepts '' as separated from `` facts '' , and vice versa . The two are interlinked in many ways .  Its only thorugh `` observation '' of similarities between facts that ideas and concepts emerge . That is if it is observed that in a culture all providers of food and security and termed as `` Father/Mother '' , it means there is more to nomenclature than the biological relationship . Its no conincidence that Hitler was termed `` Fuherer '' i.e. father .  On the other hand , once an idea or concept has been `` obserevd '' and `` established '' through the study of `` facts '' , it provides a medium for understanding of all future factual observations . That is whether they support or oppose the idea or concepts .  Hence , observation of `` facts '' is both the `` initiator '' and `` distiller '' of concepts .  In this light , it will be fool hardy to see ideas and concepts as opposed to facts . Both of them are equally important for real learning . Students need to understand a `` concept '' through assimilation of facts . Concurrently a concept or idea provides the medium for assimilation of large number of facts . Both are inseparable for complete learning .	HIN
I am agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . It is true that youth of today is not much concerned about the well being of his society and is busy in pursuing his own individual interests but they are not wholly to be blamed for this because there are various other factors which prevent them from contributing to their society and community .  To start with take the example of cut throat competition all around the world in every field due to technological advancement , where every individual , every firm is striving hard to achieve maximum efficiency and hence maximum benefit out of limited available resources in their hand .  Right from the point child take admission in the primary school , he has to cater to the expectations of his parents , friends etc . Then with population increasing and resources decreasing , their are limited vacancy in higher school , colleges and good universities for the students so there also they have to compete in entrance examinations for the limited seats . Then even once in , there is not much relief since the academic curriculam is so hectic that one does not have enough time to look after other peoples who need help . and we alsoo in this situation we can not expect from someone to take out time from his busy schedule and devote it to the community .  Then coming to the time one gets job and starts working in some business or firm , there also the young man are expected to do hard work , if they want a better and secure future .  However despite these points , i will not deny the careless attitude of the youth towards their community . Due to globalisation and mixing of culture , young people are more attracted towards the materialistic pleasures and are not ready to understand the responsibility they have on their shoulders for the society and community , which has given so much to him to make the person , he today is , and now it is his obligation from the ethical considerations , that he gives some payback to the same community .

Indeed , many succeful people in the history were willing try new things and take risks , but do all the succeful people try new things and take risks ? I do n't think so . I think successful people are the ones who are topest in thier field . If he or she can do one thing best , he or she will be a succeeful person . For this point of view , successful people do not always have to try new things and take risks .  We see some one who do somethings new and succeeds , so that we say succed people `` always '' try new thing and take risk . I thinK it 's too abrupt . We will say that , because we only see the succeful ones . We have little chances to the failed one . Trying new things and taking risks also means high prossibilty of failure . Therefore , many people prefer to spend their time on what is already known . and they work hard so that they can outbeat their rivals .  Also , only the `` try '' is not enough . We have to spend more time and energy to improve the invitation . And the improvement part are more annoying and complicate . If he or she are one who are only willing to spend their time to find or invite somethhimg new , but too lazy to improve it , he or she will not succeed . On the other hand , if there is a one who are willing to work hard to find the imporving ways , one is more likely to succed that the original invitor or finder .  Take Janpan for example . TheAmerican invite cars , but they do n't spemd time to improve cars . And Janpanese spend a lot of time and money to improve cars . Now , Janpan becomes the biggest contry producing cars .  Therefore , I think the keypoint of success is not trying new things , but willing to work hard or not .	CHI
I agree with the statement that , `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . '' My opinion about this topic is based on personal experiences as well as personal opinions .  Who has not seen an advertisement that appealed to his/her own needs and wants ? Furthermore , I will go a step further and say that I am sure that almost everyone has bought a product because he/she remembered an advertisement about it . Advertisements are temptous and play with the customer 's emotions . In addition , the way they are put together they appeal to the viewers ' eyes ; it makes them want to have whatever is displayed on the advertisement . In the center of Advertisements is usually a woman with a perfect body , few clothes , a big smile . Moreover , this kind of advertisement makes woman want to be her and men want to get her . At this point the product being sold is not as important as the emotion involved in the advertisement . For example an advertisement for a cigarettes company sells a cancerous stick to people by presenting a tan , attractive , and good-looking woman with a glowing cigarette in her hand on a huge billboard . Do people really want to start smoking or rather be as good-looking as the woman . Now , this supports the fact that the advertisement makes the product seem much better than they really are .  Another point to be made in this commentary about the statement is that even is people do not try to be influenced by the products sold on advertisements , they are still influenced by them . As soon as people leave their house they are surrounded by advertisement on huge billboard , on trucks driving by , on school blackboards , or in magazines and newspapers . These advertisements will store subconsciously . If people then go to the crocery store to make their weekly supplies they will remember what they saw on the billboards . They might buy those products and recognize that what they bought was not as good as they thought it would be . They are surprised by the fact that the advertisements sold them this product and , more important , made it look better than it actually was .  In conclusion , it seems athat in today 's world we are surrounded and enclosed by advertisements and people who try to sell things . This is the reason why it is hard to distinguish whether the product being sold is actally worth buying or if it is just trying to trick our eye . It is important for people to recognize that not everything advertised will have exactly the same effect on everybody or will taste the same way to everyone . But also I had to make the experience first before I recognized that `` advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''	GER
Last year , my girlfriend and I went to the Disneyland of Hong Kong led by a group . After the whole trip , we found that we did not have much memeries about the Disneyland because the the group gave us such a hurry travel that we even did not have enough time to have a little more pictures . As a result , I decided to have my tourism with my tour guide forever .  There are several reasons that help me to make the decision . Firstly , some people stand on the ground that the group travel is much more economical than led by tour guide . As far as I am concerned it is questionable . The tour guide you emolyed is not very expensive , and the guy will give you much more than your imangation . It is the dream place does not apper on your tourism book . At the same time , you will have enough time to take the photos and breath the air of freedom from your city . We spend our money to enjoying our life , but in the tour group . we just keep moving to another palce when we do not regconise what we have seen here . It is a really waste of our money and our life in my eyes .  Secondly , we can find ourselves by the tour guide . In the group we are the worker , we must listen to this , listen to that . We spend our mony to enjoying our life , we do not need a leader to have a tourism . It is no longer our office . There is no boss ! The nature and we are here ! That is the ture life , we are the leader of our life , we are the leader of the tourism . Where I want to go , I make the decision .  Thirdly , perhaps the travelling in group is more safe , we can face the problem together which happend in our tourism . But we should konw that everyone of us should be brave to face any challenge in our life . To solve the problem is one part of the tourism which we really appreciate . And you have a tour guide who will help anytime , because we are the boss . We spend our money and time to enjoying our life , to enjoying the problems .  From what we dissussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that althogh the advantages of travelling in a group will bring safetyand reletivly economical is considerable , they can not compete with true life of tourism led by a tour guide when its responsibility is taken into deliberation . So pack yourself up . Now , Enjoy our life !	CHI
Enjoyment is a part of the human life and all humans want to enjoy at their own pace some by going to tours , by having parties , going for drives , etc . I agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than the older people do '' . As the title suggests young and old , we can say that young will have more capability and ability than old to enjoy the life . There are many factors for that like improvement in technology , considering the age factor , stress factor etc .  As there is improvement in the technology day-by-day , there are new things for enjoyment like going for drives , spending their liesure time with friends in pubs and resturants , many amusement parks which gives recreation from their daily workload , etc . Normally older people can not make their way to the above mentioned places bacause it may be because of their age , health and some may not knew also who stay in remote areas about these kind of places and what mostly older people want is to spend their life peacefully-free from all the tensions and most of them will spend at their home itself with their grand children and by some other means .  Most of the young people will enjoy more compared to older people because of stress also . It is also one of the factor bacause they have to work all the time from morning to evening with full stress and to overcome that stress , there should be some means of enjoyment which were not available at the time of their older ones . Moreover as they were young , they are energetic and they have the ability to roam around the places with complete enthusiasum .  Consider an example of a 20 year old boy and his grand father . The boy have many ways and opportunities to enjoy his life as he is energetic firstly and there are many ways for his enjoyment as there is improvement in the technology where as his grand father can not enjoy as the boy does because he is older and his age may not be cooperatative with that . It may be also that he may not be familiar with new kind of enjoyments which were brought by technology .  As there is more improvement in the technology , there are many ways to enjoy as mentioned in the above paragraphs and surely our next generations will enjoy more than what we are enjoying now as there will be improvement in the technology in the coming years and they will have better opportunities morethan what we have .  Ofcourse there are some ways for the older people also to enjoy but their health conditions may not support for that . So i strongly support the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do by considering certain factors and examples which were mentioned in the above paragraphs .	TEL
Guests at dinner parties are appreciated for their ability to have a pleasant and rich conversation with anyone about nearly anything . At this game , people with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and a sense of conversation will have the upper hand . However , once the dinner has ended , such a proficiency in so many areas might result to be little more than an annoying flaw of character .  Knowledge is a vital tool to understand ourselves and the world we live in . So , what is wrong with trying to know as much as possible in as many academic subjects as possible ? One answer to that question could be that the pursuit is self-defeating , indeed , the more we learn , the more we realize we know little . Given this state of things , pursuing knowledge for its own sake might seem absurd . The acquisition of knowledge should be motivated by something else than intellectual pleasure .  Each person has his or her own personnal interests , career objectives , ambitions , dreams , or big unresolved questions . These could drive people to want to know more . Moreover , these forces will often lead someone to look deeper in one specific subjects than in others .  On the other hand , valuing knowledge for its own sake will lead people to waste their efforts in an incoherent way in a vain attempt to know more . Finally , a motivated approach to one or few subjects , might lead someone to understand things better , to find answers , or even to achieve something .  To conclude , it might be better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Above all , it is important that this pursuit of knowledge should be motivated by something else than the arrogant goal of just wanting to know more .	FRE
As it is said that high return can not be gotten without high risk , it seems to be true that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know . However , I disagree with the idea because of following reasons .  Firstly , success can be achived if you continue doing what you already know how to do well . For example , in Japanese traditional arts like Kabuki or Nou , the performers repeat the practice of the same story every day from the day they start the practice when they are 3 years old or so to the day they die . However , we all admit that they could succeed in fully expressing the traditional arts as parts of Japanese culture . The same also applies to traditional craftmakers or even professional baseball players . They improve their abilities by repeating the same things which is the most familiar to them every day . These examples are enough to deny the statement above .  Besides , even if trying new things brings you the chances for success , new things must mean the things which is new to everyone , not to the person alone . Someone who always change their focuses can not have a chance to get success .	JPN
I do n't agree with the following statement : `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . I think that the correct statement will be the exact opposite . I 'm gonna defend my point of view first by prooving that to success people need to study , then the success need to been build step by step and finally the success is coming from others trust .  Fist of all , I personnaly think that to succeed , studying is needed . Going to college is not a risk but the opposit , an insurrance in life . That an invest in life to a better future and and a secure one . Of course going to college can be see as something new at the beginning , but it 's not exactelly like that . It 's more like a continuation of a reach to knowledge . By having a degree , people learn how to do something good .  The second reason why I disagree with this statement is because I think that success is something which needs to be built . It 's not coming easely and fast . That 's a long daily work and to increase chance to achieve it , stability is requiere . Runing and rushing from one plan to an other one wo n't lead no where .  Finally , I think that to success in life trust from folks is a must have . Without trust there is no possible real success . And taking risk is the worst way to reach that trust from people around . Again , the trust is something to build day after day . And to get it a knowledge in the activity is also requiere , nobody is gonna trust somebody new in a realm who does n't know what he is talking about .  Of course success can come to someone who is taking risk , but it 's like the lottery it is happening to one in a million . I think that knowledge , stability and trust are the keys to success .	FRE
I strongly believe in the saying `` Change is the only constant in life . '' According to me a person who changes with time and tries new things can be successful . Some people just want to play it safe and do not want to take any risks in life . They want to stay in the same place , work in the same company and even like to eat the same kind of food . These people have very few chances to be successful .  I think it is very important to have the courage take risks in life . But at the same time a person should also be intelligent to analyze his plan of action . For example if a person wishes to start a company he should plan and work on a lot of things . Firstly he analyze the market and see what effect his product has on the market . Then he should take take care of the finances . Starting a company or business or any enterprise requires a lot of courage because it might be work and it might not .  So one should have the confidence and courage to go out in this competitive world and give your best shot . If you fail once it does not mean that you will fail everytime . One should keep trying till he or she succeds . But it is also important to learn from your mistakes and try not to repeat them . failing once should not stop you from trying new	HIN
Although I understand why some people think it is more important for students to learn facts , I think that it 's more efficient for them to understand ideas and concepts . To my view , there are three reasons why ideas and concepts prevail . First , ideas and concepts enable a student to understand not only one fact but also plenty other facts because facts happen once and ideas can explain many facts . For example , you can know how to cook a specific cake but if you understand how cakes are made in general you will be able to cook every cake . It means that by understanding a fact , a student would be able to anticipate only this precise fact next time he experiences it . Instead , if a student understands the concept he will be able to anticipate the outcome of many related facts .  Secondly , ideas and concept are the first things that you learn at school and I think it is efficient . For instance , in mathematics , you always begin by learning the rules before applying them . Moreover , theory is something that gather information from the experience of other people . That is exactlwhat the teacher is teaching : concentrated experience rather than a fact .  Last , according to my personnal experience I think it 's more important to understand first ideas and concepts . I created a fashion company but I knew only a few things about this industry . Thanks to my knwloedge that I have learned in class I was able to adapt and anticipate things as I already knew this industry . For example , marketing concepts can be used for every industries . By using them I was able to cleat the hurdle which was my ignorance of the industry .  To conclude , I think that ideas and concepts prevail on facts and that is why . Still , as I said at the beginning , I understand people who think the opposite because you need to fact to understand how to apply the theory .	FRE
I think that for a student are very imporatant both understanding ideas , concepts and learning facts . But I do n't agree that ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts . The following reasons support my idea ; first of all , It is useless if we understand a lot of concepts and ideas and we do n't use them to learn facts . I want to say that learning concepts is a very important thing if we are able to use those concepts to do useful things . Therefore , learning new concepts is very important , but also we must learn from facts , to see as those concepts are used .  For example , I am an universitary student and every day , during the lessons , I learn a lot of concepts . But I study in a technical university , therefore for me is very important to make a lot of experience to improve my preparation in a particular subject . Furthermore , it 's very important to learn facts , because always it can come in useful in the future . The second reason , that push me to think in this way , is that if we only understand ideas and concepts , we will not understand completely as those concepts work . I want to say that there are a lot of things that we can learn only from facts and experience . I think that a student has a good preparation about a particulr subject if he learn both concepts and experience . In fac , in a lot of company if a person wants to gain an advancement he must have a lot of experience and a lot of	ITA
I disagree with the idea that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way . There are two reasons to support my opinion . First , in a group tour , you ca n't visit places freely . If the place you want to visit is not very popular , there are a few plans you can choose . When I was a high school student , I visited Kyoto in a group of my school . Then , I wanted to go to Sanzyusangen temple . However , the plan of the tour does n't include the temple . Therefore , I could n't visit there .  Second , although the time to look around the place is usually limited in a group tour , you can spend time to look around as much as possible . You would n't be able to understand the history of the place if the time for sightseeing is limited . When I went to Todaiji temple in my school trip , I could't check carefully the explanation of the temple or statues of god because I did n't have enough time . Furthermore , when you walk around the place or the town , you may notice good things that you could n't find in a group tour , for example , the kindness of people there or delicious foods . When I traveled to Tokyo alone , I got lost . Then people there helped me . This is very important exper	JPN
Young people enjoy life more than older people do . I agree with this statement young are enegetic and have the curiosity to enjoy and accomplish things . Young people will have good friends , they spare good amount of time with friends , going on vacations , partying in the weekends and lot more . While old people contacts will be very less they only enjoy certain times , like if any relative come to your house .  First of all , young people study in universities , in universities they not only study but involve in so many recreational activities ... Environment of the university will be very good , they enjoy in canteens with many friends . Where old people does't have the chance .  Secondly , youngsters will be energetic and enjoy a lot by participating in games like playing shuttle , cricket . Other than their amusement they can keep their health fit .  In good communities , there may be social organisations in the month end . Young people participate in these social organizations and may arrange large events like conducting games , providing orchestra etc . In games young people participate largely and try to entertain other people in the social organization .  Universities will give long vacations in the year end , which will have good chance for the youngsters to plan and spend lots of time enjoy themselves during their vacations . They can go to other places to see their relatives and find some time spend with their relatives . Yougsters have the propensity to spend time by watching movies , these movies are interesting and enjoy them selves .  Taking into account of all these factors , youngsters will enjoy lot more than the older people becase the environment hey have in the community .	TEL
Nowadays , with the technology making significantl progress , Our live become more and more wonderful and convinent . So many people begain considering how to enjoy their life . As a young people , however , i strongly disagree the statement on the left screen and there are too many instance to support my view .  Firstly , as we know , our society is becoming aging and our warfare becoming more and more lighten . That give a rise to new situation that so many elders spend their leisure hours in travel . That is why the travel agency is the one of the most lucrative industry in this era . For examlp , my parents usually spend 4 months in different cites .  In addition , many older people have less presuer from jobs than young people . Most of them have fixed pension . They do n't worry about their finacial problem . That give them chance to enjoy life .  My uncle get a incridible pension and he do n't save it . He usually spend so much in food and intertaiment .  Furthermore , our society need youth to make progress . That can continue a great cycle . If we enjoy life , that means we do n't want a confortable life when we become old . Any developed countris should has many ambitious youth to maintain its prosperousity  From what has been discussed above , we can finally draw the conclusion that the older people enjoy life more than young people .

The word advertisement comes from the root ` advert ' , which means ` to draw attention ' . The central motive of all advertisements , is infact to get considerable attention . And the advertisements , generally go beyond simple enumeration of product feautures . They try to make a product look much better than it really is . I totally agree with the statement .  While , advertisements today are much more sophisticated , than they were a few decades ago , the chief theme of an advertisement was always to get more public attention , so that the products could sell better . Initally in 70s or 80s , only the features of a product and customer testimonials were greatly exaggerated . This made a product look much better , than it really was . Inflated customer testimonials helped create a sense of a happy consumer . While , such techniques were already creating a sense of false product perception , it is only in past 1 or 2 decades , has the advertising become so complex and sophisticated . People , children and adults are beguiled by the aura ` modern advertisement ' creates about a product . This aura is better known as ` The Brand ' among the marketing and advertising firms .  These modern advertisements basically create implicit associations of certain product types with certain behaviors , in the consumer minds . Associations like - if you drive ` Car Z8 ' you are cool . Or if you use certain perfumes , you will be much more attractive to the opposite sex . These associations create illusions in front of consumers , hence ensuring that they can not make rational and logical choices about products . Moreover , with such advertising it is no longer necessary for a product to be good , in order to be commercially successful . A regular garment line with similar designs , could command twice the price with a celebrity endorsement . Such , techniques ensure that consumers and the manufacturing companies ignore what is really important - the product , and not it 's aura .  Also , this false image , contributes to what is called the mad consumerism . People getting insane to get certain is not good for society . With advertisements and branding people are sometimes unable to seperate wheat from the chaff . What is really important and what is just a fake .  I strongly believe , the advertisements make a product look much better using various methods . However , such marketing does harm to the society in general , and consumers in particular .	HIN
I am not quite sure about my oppinion on that topic . There are several advantages and disadvantages on both sides .  First being a specialist is like a goal you can acchieve , fullfilling the dream of being `` the best '' that everyone has . It is like a motor for working harder . And of course it needs experts for innovation . You have to have the time and power to think about new ways and to be able to make experiments . Specialisation has always played a very important role in evolution in general and moreover in the human evolution . People became experts and shared the work . So they got faster and had the knowledge , understanding and skills all together were n't able to have . In fact specialization is the key to our culture , without it there would be no kind of art .  On the other hand one might say that experts are very good in one single topic but quite stupid in everyday life . They are depending on others - so there could never be a world full of experts it always needs people who work together with them , have to share their skills . An other important point is `` having an overview '' . If you have knowledge in various areas you can see the conections , how one thing influences the other . And you can draw your conclusions .  You than have the possibility to find surprising answers for problems because you don ' t think in the `` ordinary '' way . Last not everyone is interested in all the different academic subjects and/or the skills and therefore is n't motivated .  In context of education - as I understand this question - I would say best way is a combination of both . You first have to know some basic information and gain skills that are fundamental in every field of academic subjects . But when you find out than one topic arrouses your special interrest and you have the gift to work in this field and be good than you should ahve the possibility to spezialize .  In my opinion you should never stop learning . And in these times you always have the chance to ask someone if you do n't understand or do n't know something . It is very important to be a `` good ' expert - concentrate on what you can do best but do n't forget to look around from time to time .	GER
Altough some educators who works in the field of education beleiving learning facts is realy important for all the students , most other educators claim that understanding the ideas and concepts will be useful in their life .  according to me , most of the emotional facts are subjective . if you learn the other peoples ideas , you can find the best way and you can evolve your own idea . it makes you a self confidence person .  self confidence people can keep up with rapid social and technological changes . accordin to the conducted from some scientist published in a education issue two mounts ago about % 65 people content with their life . This cocequence indicated us self-confidence people are more succesful and happy in their life .  Most of the students can forget their knowledge in the long time , but if you understand the texture of the information you can producing some new ideas and comparing the others .  througout of my life ? was very luck to have a good ralationship with my teachers and coworkers because above the mentioned , ? always to be a invastigater person . it makes me a person who have own ideas .

The term `` Successful '' is related to getting goals and dreams , but to get a goal means to take a risk , to do new things . So that is why succesful people like to take risks , because they know they can take the opportunity and explote it to the maximum , and thats how they go ahead and with a risk there is always a finish line , the goal , so when succesful people sees that goal in their lives they see it and do not look back or look both sides , they keep its mind to what they want and that is why they get success .  Now at days successful people take risk , try new things and opportunities , opportunities in which they have to try new things , opportunities in which they will earn experience because they do not do only what they do best , instead they are in search of new capacities they dont even know they have .  For example Bill Gates , he was a man that one day woke up and decided to take a risk , a new opportunity , a new thing , something that no one has thinked about it , maybe at those days when Microsoft did n't exist people thought that Bill Gates was crazy , but they did n't know what would that decision make him what he is today . Bill Gates is successful now at days because he took an opportunity that anybody else wanted to grab .  I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because we have to go out to the world and explore new things to see if we are good in other things , because there is a lot of people that has being successful just for taking risks , so that means we can do it to , we just have to decide to do it and DO IT and keep our mind and our eyes focused on the goal we want to reach .

I am agree , students need to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because that will make easier in the time to study for the test , and will be able to participate any time the teacher aks a question , it is really important to understand everything about the subject that helps to earn time , to study for all subjects .  A clear example I had , in Quemistry is a class in which you have to understand what the teacher is explaining because it has some exercises that even if you study you ca n't figure it out easily , so everytime I did not understand I asked my teacher . And I successfully got a good grade .  Many times students are to shy and they are afraid to ask somebody to help her in a different subject , or even the teacher does n't like to help student , so we as student we need to have a positive mind and fight for what we want , doing our best at school and been obedient following directions .  Another example I have , I am really proud of my sister she is really smart , in her test she always got good grades , and I ask her if she can give me some clues , and the answer I received from her is that I have to understand what I am reading or studying so I try to understand , now I am successful in my subjects and in my own life .  Finally , I can encourage all students have a positive mind and put their hearts on God , He is the only person we can trust .	SPA
Apparently , young people have much more time to enjoy themselves . However , it is difficult that to say that young peole enjoy life more than older people do . There is a problem somewhat too colplicated to speak easy way . Everyone enjoys their life . Indeed they enjoys their life in their own way . So young people and older people both enjoy their life , but in their specific ways .  Older people , of course , have more time to work in their field to make money for their family . Sometimes they can not have a break all day long . Even , in Asian countries , older people can not have a vacation all around year . They have great royalty to their family . Although they may complain about their life like this , they will not leave it . Sometimes they enjoy this situation , to have chance to support their family by themselves and to grow their children in better circumstance . This is the life actually they enjoy everyday .  Young people can not help enjoying their time everyday . They have no responsibility to work for someone except simple homework . So young people have much more time to spend for themselves , in my experience , more time does not mean more joyful . In fact , young people spend time useless more often than older peole do . But it is obvious that if young people can manage their life valuable , they have much more chane to ( really ) enjoy their life .  In conclusion , the critical point of about this question is not the quantity but the quality of life managing . Although older people have less time for themselves to enjoy than younger people , they can manage their life more valuable , so they can enjoy about the result .	KOR
I completely agree with the point that it is always best to travel in a group led by a guide . Guide is a person who is especially appointed by the govt . for the benefits of the visitors . He is capable of providing explicit information about the tourist places . So why not to take the benefits of the service provided when one is in a group .  Suppose you are travelling down in India with a group of friends . Here the inscriptions giving tourist place 's technical details are very limited . So a guide will thoroughly relish one with the date 's , histroy and all its related matters . Moreover if the guide is not hired it might happen that some of your friends may go to other directions as per their interest , loose the fun of being together , acknowledge less information .  It 's always greater fun to be together while visiting places . Else one may get bored . So if a group has hired a guide it will be rather involutary that the group will stay bonded . So there 's no risk of loosing someone behind on the trip .  The process of seeing new things will be extrememly sequential and meaningful because the guide will proceed step by step giving out inrtrigue infromation . The group members might have some doubts regarding the monuments . So it might happen that one might be able to understand the history better based on other 's doubts . They could even discuss more things if they have come on a school assignment trip for the history class . Also the guide will not dare to skip things inorder to save time and get more money as he fears the number of people . It usaually happens in India though . But more the people , greater the interest and this directly affects the enthusiasm of the guide .  A group could even share the tour guide 's expense so they could hire better guide than an individual .  It 's more a harmless option giving all the group members equal benefits with all the fun combined with travelling .	HIN
Ethical marketing is very significant subject that should be studied in the some departments of universities . I see lots of advertisements in television or in newspapers which describe the product as a perfect solution to customers ' problems , but , in reality it is not . I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  In all sectors , we can see these type of advertisements . Automotive , Information Technology or Consumption sectors , no matter which sector it is . All use advertisement ways to convince consumers to buy the product by emphasizing some points generally but not giving details about some unknown things which can influence the final decision to buy it . To illustrate , a MP3 player usually announced in a newspaper as a product which is 1 GB and has a radio . However , many people do not know that their radio does not work well everywhere and they even do not know how may song can be saved to that wonderfull device . Without thinking some of them buy it while others learn the reality when they go to buy it by asking questions to the sale representative .  Another example is that some advertisement tricks are implemented in prices . Prices are shown by excluding taxes and when you are very happy since you have found your favourite product and you go to buy it . Usually , it is too late to change your view and thus , you buy it .  In this sense , it is certain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are . However , by giving more importance to marketing lectures and to their content , this unethical situation can be prevented . Also , these lessons should be must courses instead of being elective .

I am happy . I am young , and I am happy . I never been old in my life so I can not know if I agree or disagree whit the statement , basing myself on my own life experience . But I do can answer basing on what I live since this time and on what I seen around me during this time . And I will say that I agree .  Their is a lot of avantages in getting older . Older people have more freedom ( they can do whatever they wanted to and do not have to ask anyone ) , they earn their life in their own so they are able to plan it better than a young people because they do not have to rely onto their parents . .. But I am still thinking that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Their is just much more things to do , things to enjoy , for young people . They do not have as much responsabilities than older people , so they do not have as much things to worry about . For example , I said that older people have more freedom , earning their own life . It is thrue . But what I did not say then , it is that their is more fun , to me , in enjoying life basicly , without any trouble in mind , or much less importants ones .  Furthemore , young people have often much more possibilities to meet new people and make new friends than older ones . Older people have to have a job to earn their life . And most of time , after the fisrt weeks im their compagny , they will see the same people , collegues , maybe for the rest of their life . A young people , doing his studies , meets a lot of new people each year when he comes to a new class . He could even meets more new people if he changes of university .  So young people meet more people , make more friends , have more fun , and have less problems to worry about . .. Well , I am also exciting to getting older and have more freedom and responsability every day , but I think that I may regrets these years one day ,	FRE
As you know , some people are so busy because their lives especially young people . There are a lot of things to do in their lives . Sometimes they work long time and they ca n't take their time . Some of them work hardly depends on their jobs . These days , people work hard because time is very important for them . They want to use exact time in their jobs . During this period they can forget to help their communities . I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .  First of all , young people has a lot of things to do . Business is very important in their lives . They want to get perfect life and to be a good family person . They work in a hard or an easy job and time is limited for them . Their community is a second thing because of their own job lives .  Secondly , young people want to give time for own their time . They do something to relax . For instance , they go to somewhere during their free time . they have some kinds of hobbies and some young people want to be alone . They can help themsleves . There is no time for their communities .  Finally , young people 's rythm is vey different or changeable . This situation depends on their own personal properties . some of them are very workholic , some of them are very lasy . Furthermore , environmental changes effect them . They can change easily about thier behaviour . Indeed , something is not important for them . They have not a good relationship between they and their family or friends . Most of works or jobs can effect them easily . They can forget what they have one family or friends .  In briefly , time can found hard because of some specific reasons to give enough time to helping someone . Indeed , giving a time to help someone depends on our hand . These days , everybody want to get a good life or a job .	TUR
I am totally agree with this statement . No matter successful people or normal people , they all need to try new things and take risks . If they only do what they already know , they are learning nothing . Successful people try new things an take risks are the best thing that they need to do . For example , a animal professior who discover medicine for humans . If they only make the medicines that we all already know and already have , so this is not called discover and they are no longer needed . Of course they need to find out new medicines and it takes risks because they test animals . Another example is students who are successful in study . Why are they successful ? The reason is they already try new things such as read a lot of different books and communicate with teachers . The risky thing is taking extra exams that are not required . If students do not read a lot of books and evaluate themselves , how can they be successful students ? They will stay the same without study new things . They can not only study what they know well . Otherwise , they can not open-minded . For me , I have a personal story about this topic . I am trying new things an also taking risks . I came to America for study . I am trying to study new cultures and language . I am not successful yet , but I am trying to be successful . Also this is a risk for me because my parents can not afford me to study university in America . The tuition is too high . My parents have to take care of me and my brother . International students can not work off-campus . I could not find any job in-campus . This is a really big challenge for me to study abroad . Therefore , I agree with statement .	CHI
I definitely agree with the statement at hand . In fact , in my opinion , this is the main goal of education itself . Education should give to the students main ideas and concepts , things that the students can absorbe , make their own , and use as a basis for further education or even for their choices in life .  Facts are like evidence in a trial , things that support the main ideas and concepts . The students have to read the facts , understand them and , even more important , understand how the facts give an example or an explanation of the main idea . They are very important for the understanding process , but at the end they are notions , they are something specific that we learn at eventually we forget . On the contrary , what really lasts in our memory is the main idea , the concept and this is the very important thing .  The first example that I can cite is history . When we study history we study a large number of facts , dates , events , meaning that we learn a large amount of notions , that we are most likely going to forget in the future . But all these facts are necessary to understand what happened in a specific period and to analyze the causes and effects that took place in those years . The facts are the instruments at our disposal to build a broader vision of the period at hand and to have a general idea of the economical or sociological or religious forces that interacted in that historical moment . Even if we eventually forget the specific dates or facts , we still keep a concept , an idea of what was happening in the past .  Moreover I think that it is sometimes even impossible for our mind to store and remember all the notions and information we read . Computer databases are in fact very good instruments to store and retain information . Our mind , on the contrary , has the wonderful ability of elaborating information , putting them together and drawing conclusions , in form of main ideas and concepts . Again , we see what is really important : ideas and concepts .  In conclusion I definitely agree with the statement at hand as I demonstrated with the examples I gave .	ITA
I do not agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . The reason being specialized study in one subject provides an indepth understanding of the subject . It is critical for research and innovations . It also helps to make a positive contribution towards societal development .  Most modern day innovations can be attributed to indepth study and research . For example , the developments in telecommunications could not have happened but for the innovations in fibre optics . These developments have revolutionized modern communication . Distances no longer matter . Life has become more easy .  In depth studies in management are critical in finding solutions to an ever growing and complex world . So , by pursuing indepth studies in a specific subject one could contribute meaningfully and effectively to the development of the world .  It is easy to dabble in many subjects . But serious study is critical for success . No doubt reading varied subjects helps broaden one 's thinking . But , one could gather basic knowledge and information about other subjects without much efforts . In this age of information and technological revolution one can have easy access to information . Further , we do not live in isolation in a society . So social exchanges and interactions would help build our information and knowledge base on other subjects .  The modern world is driven by technology and science . In this modern world one could contribute more meaninfully if one is focused and does an indepth study . Even a social scientist needs to do more indepth study to contribute meaningfully .	TEL
I agree with the statement that `` Most advertisment products seem much better than they really are '' . For two main reasons , first the main goal of advertisent is to sell and the seller would try to show their product the best they can . On the other hand advertisement campains can make the consumer think that owning the product can make them fell or be a certain way .  As said in th introduction the main goal of advertisment is to sell , and make the likeable and atractive to the consumer . These may result in distortioning the real product , for example food products , to be able to transmit a flavor , which is a sensation , on visual images , the advertiser needs to over show all the visual characteristis of a the product , this may result on a distortion of the real sizes and aparence of a food product .  As a second argument the advertisement can make consumer understand that by adquiring the product they can fell or be a certain way , for example women shampoo campains always show a prototipe of woman 's hair . The consumer may asume that the type of hair that the person on the advertisment has would be the same as that she would adquire if she uses the product . That does not necesarily means that the product seem much better than it is , just that the consumer is making assumptions over the product but this is a direct consecuence of the advertisment .  The wish of the producers to sell their product to te consumer may end up on a distortioning on the product by making them seem much better that they are , basicaly because of assumptions of the consumers is drawn to by the visual images of the advertisment .

I think that almost every advertisment makes the product it supports better than it actually is . There are three main reasons for this opinion . Firstly the main use of advertisment is to sell the product . The second reason is that if for example contracts are advertised there are mostly printed or shown on screen little paragraphs with the flaws of the contract . The last reason is that everything has not only merrits but also flaws , which are typically not displayed .  In order to sell products the producer has to display it in a good light , because otherwise similar products from other companies will be bought . This situation makes a better exposure of a product than it actuallt is very likely . An example might be creams that should improve the look of human skin . Studies proved that they show no effect , but in contrary even sometimes hamrs the skin . If this would be told in an advertisment nobody would buy the cream .  A good example for the second reason are contracts of phone companies . They often announce some but not all of the costs a special contract may produce . Because of legal statements they have to write these flaws on the advertisment but they do this in very small letters . So if you do n't look carefully you might get the impression of a much cheaper product .  In advertisments flaws of products are never told , expect there are special rights as with the phone contracts . But everything has sides that are better or worse especially if compared to other similar products . Advertisment do not speak about these things where other comparable products can prove better results . So they always hide some sides of the product . To show this hidden characterisitcs almost every product is tested by independent magazines or something alike . For exaample computer magazines that test hardware and software .  So you can not rely on advertisments .	GER
First you have to get an idea about community help . Which jobs count . The tipically ideas are helping the Red Cross or other refundable organisations . In my oppinion every activity which helps people to have a good day or some nice moments count . For example helping at a sports event or babysitt the kids of your neighbor , is also a good thing . With this you help your neighbohrs to have some time off and enjoy there own interests . Nowadays many young people have a lot of different hobbies . So they are involved in other things and does not want to cut their spearetime down . They are not so motivated like some years ago . You can see this by different organisations , they lake for students to help them . A other point is the money . It is not sure that they earn some money for their help , but money got so important for young people . Why should they help other people and offer their time and get nothing than a smile ? These things does not count so much . I am pretty sure most young people would have the time to help but they are not interessed . You could get back so much , if you help others . If the parents would help in the community by themself it would be a motivation for some children to do it too . Mostly I agree with the statement , but there are still some individuals outside , which do there best . They offer their time and are not interested in money . I know some people who tryed to get money to help children . So that they had the possibility to buy toys . I baysitted at various events , so that the parents could enjoy their time and had not to worry about their chil	GER
Many people like to take the shortcut to complete their goals . It is true that it is easier to work on tasks with numerous strategies that are already discover . However , I strongly believe that the real successful people try new things and take as much risks as they need .  To begin with , although money is not always the best material to measure one 's success , most of the billionaires started something on their own for the first time . Bill Gates created Microsoft program for people 's efficiency in using computer at affordable costs before anybody else thought of it . To pursue that business , he had to drop out of Harvard University and concentrated only on his new business . It must have been a hard choice to do so , since Harvard is an extremely competitive school to get into . Now Bill Gates is one of the richest man in the world .  My own father is another good example for the same situation . Born to a poor family , he entered a hardest medical school in my hometown in South Korea with his own efforts . However , he changed his major to engineering , giving up his easy way to success by staying in the medical school . After studying in the engineering school , he pioneered biomedical engineering and became the first doctor of biomedical engineering in Korea by founding the subject in his college . If he had not done this , he was sure to be a medical person , but not the first biomedical engineer in nation .  I myself already took one big risk in order to be successful - coming to America . I could continue my education in the insstitutions of high level in my native country , as a selected student in science in previous years . Yet , I had a strong desire to try new things with the cost of risking what might seem to be important in certain moment , and still do . Of course there are many obstacles I need to overcome , but I believe it will be paid of if I try hard enough just like Bill Gates and my dad did in their youth .	KOR
My opinion is very simple . .. i think that is true , young people do n't give enough time to helping their communities . But i think that they are n't totaly guilty of this . In many case the actions of a person born to the contest when they spent their life . .. Family , school , frieds and tv and all of the things that a person do in the first part of his life will influence his personality . The gift that a young people take to his life coach , are deeply wrong . It 's true that people do n't help enough their communities , but is early true that at the moment there is n't good examples to follow and so will become everybody best person .  I know that there are many person that are more intersting to help everyone , but for me this person are early a small number . I'am very intersting for this theme . .. really !!! At the moment , in fact , i work on a call center that help some students of my country that have family problems and thei do n't have the possibility to explain their problem to anyone . ..  For this reason i think that is very , very , very important tell to all the people to do the right thing and begin to help the people that are around we . And the better way is beginning to is't the first of all	ITA
To my mind , it is not possible to generally say whether young or old people enjoy life more ; I think one can enjoy life at any age , it depends on the age in which way one enjoys it .  Being young as well as being old have both negative and positive aspects . Of course younger people have the great advantage of being physically more able than older people , this way they have more possibilities to enjoy life by playing sports . But usually , they do not have much time to realize that since they are busy with school or job . Older people , when they are already retired , have a lot of time to do all those things they have not had time for yet , for example reading literature or even begin studying , as for example an old teacher of mine who started studying philosophy after he left school .  Because of their many experiences , it is also easier for old people to deal with problems while young people are often discouraged and feel insecure about the future . Old people already lived through many things , they do not have to worry about finding a job or a partner any more .  While young people often have problems with their families , old people already have their own and can spend nice times with them . The greatest problem of being old are certainly the many illnesses . It is much more dangerous for old people to walk outside if it is cold , they might get pneumonia while young people remain healthy and could slip on the ice and brake a leg while their grandchildren are able to fall without hurting themselves .  In addition , it is very sad to be old when one 's friends , or one 's partner , become older , too , and die one by one . My grandfather became 93 years old and had not had friends for the last ten years of his life , which seems incredible to me .  Finally , a young person still has all his life before him ; an old one expects the death to come soon . Both can be positive or negative , it depends on the specific person 's situation .  On the whole , I think it is possible to enjoy one 's life at any age , it just matters what one makes out of it .	GER
Some people believe that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide but I disagree with sentence .  First , If we should n't travel with tour guide , we can sight seeing any where For example , In the past year I went to Japan with my freinds without tour guide . I think it is not at all also we could arrive to the japan well and went on a shopping , took the picture with native people . ect . in this travel , we get along with my freinds .  Second , we can be known to travel place history . By without a tour guide , we can study about the travel place history . Nowdays , According the international social develop , we can saw many Japan 's informationg and history . such as read a tour guide book and the Internet web surffing .  In this reasons , I think I like the best way to travel is in a group without tour guide leader .	KOR
I agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialinzing in one specific subject .  There are some reasons why I think that way .  First of all , it is crucial to choose someone 's future once . Because it is too early to decide what to study . The more we experience , the more we can choose . We do n't know what we really want to do yet . Because , we could n't have such a enough time to think . Most university students are not sure about their future .  In my case , I choosed French as my major . And I have worked with French . After 2 years , I was confused if my choice was right or not . I decided to take some english classes and talked to professor about my situations . I could think of my problem enoughly after it . Lastly , I decided to dounble major English and French . If I did n't take English classes , I would n't know what I exactly want to study in the university because I would n't even know I like to study English .  Secondly , sometimes people do n't have many knowledge out of their major . And this can make boring person . Now days , society wants people who have many interests and talents . And we can learn those information from other activities such as other academic subjects . From those studies , we can explore other majors .  For instance , there are leisure sports deparment in my university . Many of my friends were interested in jazz danses and physical exercises like body building . Even though their major was not leisure sports , they took those classes and had a lot of fun .  From those subjects , Not only could they enjoy their campus lives but also could make great memories and experiences .  Until graduating from highschool , we could n't choose what I want to study , and we have rights to choose many subjects and to get interesting information from outside of our major .  This can be very helpful in our campus lives .	KOR
To try to give an answer to this important question i would say that i do n't really agree . In my mind we have to keep facts in mind to improve and to understand concepts . For instance , when we made some mistakes we always could and should learn about it . That 's why i think that some facts are really importants . Concerning Nasism , we ca n't ignore that it has existed and this because people made some great mistakes . They choose to put confidence in a leader which was a dictator and it ended in a war that we could have avoided .  Now that we know how that kind of ideology can be , we are aware that we better have to choose quietlier . But learning about some other facts is not always as important as it is in this case . Some facts are useless if we consider courses as philosophy . Some acts influence our lives and our behaviours but some other are nothing interesting to developp conscience and awareness . But when we study this other point it raises another issue which is directly linked to my first opinion : we have to learn facts to learn in general . How ? Because everthing that seems to mean nothing to you is meaning more than you believe . Nevertherless we can understand lots of things without have learn everything about the subject . We can know world war two without being born and having lived during this war . You learn that there were millions people who died for your freedom but even if you did n't felt what is was to be affraid of bombs you can understand what it is like .  So to conclude i would like to underline that it does n't matter with the way we improve things . The most important is to be interesting when you try to learn something to someone and to be curious when it is you that is learning . We learn from everything but not only from facts .	FRE
Nowadays it 's very important to have a good academic formation to get an interesting job and realize yourself , but this should be reached in two ways : a broad knowledge and a specific knowledge .  I 'm italian , so I 'm influenced by the italian typical school system based on a big knowledge of many subjects . In fact when I was at school I studied a lot of subject , including Latin and ancient Greek , and when I was at the university I took twentyfive exames on different aspects of economics .  I think that it 's important to have a broad knowledge of many subjects because today when you work you need to be more flessible than before ; a lot of things are changed and it 's quite different from the beginning of the twentieth century when Ford teorized the `` work specialization '' .  But , probably in some case it should be different ; for example an ingeneer needs to know a lot of things in a specific subject and he must specialize in a specific construction sector , and , I think , it 's similar for medicians .  On the other hand , my preparation is general because I would become a manager , and it 's konw that a manager must be resolve a lot of different problems in different ways , you may use your ability to find new solution to the problems .  For example , if you have a problem selling a product because the market does n't like it , you have two choises : the first is to retire the product from the market and second one , which is more creative , is to find a good marketing solution to make the product `` pulled '' by the market .  In conclusion , I think that you must choos your formation depending on your interests and your future job .	ITA
The issue of whether one should have broad knowledge of many subjects or one should specialize in one specific subject has aroused heated debates in the modern era . Advocates for the broad knowledge concept say that this approach will help in widening the outlook of the person . Contary to this approcah , some people say that this is the world of specialization and it is very important to be a master in one subject to be successful in life . I personally feel that there should be a balance between the two approches . I would present the pros and cons of each of the approach and then illustrate why I emphasize on the balanced approach .  In today 's dynamic world , it is imperative for a person to have a broad knowledge of various academic subjects . This will not only help to acquire a broader perspective but also increase the efficiency in decision making of a person . Say for example a marketing manager of a Fast Moving Consumer Goods company deicdes to launch a promotional campaign for a product . The knowledge about the financial issues related to the campaign can be really helpful in the decision making . If he does not have knowlege about finance then he can make an expensive plan which can be finally rejected due to the financial constraints of the company . Knowledge about other subjects such as finance , strategy and human behaviour can help the manager in making better informed decisions . This example clearly shows the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .  On the other hand , there is no denial to the fact that this is a highly competitive world . The most prominent successful people today are the ones who are specialists in their respective fields . A very obvious example are the successful doctors . Not only these doctors have to specialize in fields such as dentistry , pathology etc. but also they have to acquire higher post graduate degrees in the specialist fields . Very few people today would prefer going to a general doctor for their medical problems .  I would support a balanced approach as I feel this can make a person a balanced individual who has enough broad perspective to make effective decisions and is specialist in his own field . If the marketing manager in the above example is a person with broad knowledge about many academic subjects then he might find it difficult to devise a marketing strategy , which needs core and in depth study about marketing related policies . Similarly if he is just a typical marketing specialist , he may ignore other vital information related to different subjects and end up giving a poor solution . If he takes a balanced approach where he is a specialist in his area but also knows about other subjects , he will make better decisions and will succeed in life .	HIN
In my opinion in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ; although this statement can sound totally unaware of the fact that cars ' possessors are quickly growing all over the world , I will now explain the reasons for my idea .  Cars ' prices have been decreasing slightly in the past few decades : originally born as a super-luxury status symbol back in the end of the nineteenth century , we can therefore clearly state that today cars are a commodity affordable by almost anyone in any industrialized country . However , this apparently good change of the situation , has led to two extremely negative effects : the abrupt rise in oil prices , and a tremendous impact on the planet 's environment .  Firts things first , since cars are produced and sold even in big , heavily populated countries like China and India ( together comprehending more than one third of the world population altogether ) , markets where once they were unavalible to almost the totality of people , their demanded quantity has risen to the sky , and so the fuel prices : petroleum extracting sites are used in a more and more savage way , but the lack of offer of this fundamental mineral caused , according to a very well known economic law , an increase in its price . As of today , even extracting sites placed very far from any valuable market , or very expensive to use , have been approaching by excracting companies ( e.g. in Alaska , in the North Sea , through Oceanic platforms . .. ) after the traditional sites ' shortage .  It is my opinion that the oil prices , unfortunately , rise more and more , to the point where cars will be once again an item affordable by , and only by , very rich people , therefore decreasing significantly their number . The only solution to this inevitable economic disaster would be to find some alternative energy font ; however , researches in that field have been growing slowly in the last years , thus our energetic future is not looking bright at all .  Besides , how not to mention the fact that since cars ' use spread around every continent ( and it 's gonna be worse and worse in the short period ) pollution 's effects on global environments have icreased so much ? Cars are not what you might call an ecological way of transportation : having more and more of them drinving around all over the world might even lead to the worst solution . Some scientist , in fact , even came to think that , if their number is still going to increase over the years , world governmentscould even ban them from using , so to prevent the enivronment , that however , by that day will probably be seriously compromised .  To summarize , I think that cars ' number will grow in the short period , until it will be too much to afford them ( in economical and ecological means ) : since that moment on I believe there will be fewer and fewer of them , even less than today .

The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is may right , but in my opinion it could be said not only for young people and not only nowadays .  I think the time after childhood and befor adulthood have been a difficult time eversince . Teenager have enough to do helping themselfe , so they are may even the only agegroup who should not be blamed for being a bit selfish . But even after you reached your twenties succesful , there is a high number of realy ignorrant and selfish people . It goes on during every ageclass . It is easy to blame the young ones , but even most middel-age and older people are looking away if something uncomfortable happens .  Anyway , this do not mean , that the statement , that young people nowadays do not care enough , is wrong . If there are too many people in every ageclass who do not spend enough time to help their communities , the younger ones are includet . But in my opinion , most times , they are at least the most helpful orientated group , at least after they maneged their teenage . Just because there are more often more open minded young people than older ones .  Wich brings us to the word `` nowadays '' . It is may likely that in passed times the family bond was stronger , so there was more help during most families for each other . But the community does not mean only the people we love , but also people who are may totaly different , with opinions we do n't share , with behaviors we do n't understand . But to help the community means even to help them , if help is needed . To help some stranger on the street was way more uncommon in past times but today . And even if most of the charity organisations have mostly older members and helpers , it does n't mean that the younger generation do n't care . Most times the young people are thoses who want to change something .  I totaly agree that there are not enough people who spend enough time to help their communities , but at the end you ca n't blame it only to the younger ones nowadays . It is and was a general problem .	GER
The advertisements that are in the television and in the stores are not reliable because they always lie and they always try to fool us in an indirect way . The companies that produce those products do this to convince us that the product is worth every penny you pay for it . In this respect , when we buy the product , we discover that the information of the advertisement may have been about another product because we find the product totally different from what has been described in the advertisement .  In addition to that , some companies exaggerate the description of the product by saying that it has super charecteristics and abilities , but the truth is different . the truth of the product is exaggerated to make people buy it and so the company make alot of profits at the expense of the people 's own money	ARA

I agree tha young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping theur communitiy They are not learned by older people that what they can do for communuty . They are so busy now .  First of all , young people ca n't find old people to teach them what thay can do for community . I beliave house-teaching , helping their commununity , is very important to young people . Old people usually teach them to young people . Nowaday , we are living seperate with old people . Young people do not have chance to learne what they should do .

I agree only partially with the statement that broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better than to specialize on one specific subject . In my opinion it is not enough to have a vast knowledge in one subject . People tend to be narrow-minded if they do not know about any subject but their specific one . A mathematic for example can make up a theoretic statistic about the spread of a disease for example but he will have to conclude certain irregularities to show the real process .  Furthermore , a certain amount of basic knowledge is important to everyone to participate in daily discussions or to built up a political attitude for instance . And every employer expects basic knowledge from his potential employees . For example about the current political and economic situations .  Therefore it is definetly important to be familiar with more than one single topic . Nevertheless , it is obvious that students have to concentrate on one academic topic if they want to compete with others in a job . They have to know as much as possible about this one specific subject and they have to pay attention to learn about the newest changes and innovations in this subject .  And apart from the competitiveness it some situation it could also be very dangerous if someone has only broad knowledge of a subject . A doctor with broad knowledge of medicine for example is the worst imaginable danger .  Apart from that the whole service sector is based on the fact that people know about one single topic in detail while others know about another . Nobody can learn enough about every subject for professionals would be superfluent .  To draw a conclusion , students should specialize on one specific subject and apart from that they should learn as much as possible about other subjects . Everybody should use his talent to the greatest extention .	GER
Yes , i agree to the statement . we need to keep broad knowladge on all academic subjects when compare to specific subject .  Becouse in plimanary studys each one of the subject is inter link with other subject . means getting some knolwdage on each and every revelent subject is good for basics of studys . vains are connect to each and every part of the body and supplys blood to function in good health . if a person is suffering form internal pain from a body , the patceient is to carry to hospital and checkep by the doctor and identified some deficts . planed to do opperation each and every doctor should have some knowladge on all parts of human body naither than that doctor can not make operation with out having knowladge in relivent parts . suddenally the doctor is having good knowladge in vains for example , a general doctor can not read about one topic are one specific subject . in human body each and every part is related with another part , so the person who studying doctor to need all relevent subjects of human body to be a successful doctor .  Where as in mathemetical caliculations to caliculate the estimated cost of project , needs addition , ubstraction , muliplication & division . then only the final result will be appear . so some of the cases there should be good knowladge in relivent subjects and same as we can improve the communication and good relitaion ship between among people . we need to have knowladge in all aspects , then only we can servive in the society . having good knowladge all aparts is good . each and every genious is to have waste experan  So we use to have broad knowledge on academic subjects is good off specific subject	TEL
Currently , the issue `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is debated by numerous educationalisties and scientist . In my personal points of view , I prefer yong people enjoy life more than older people do . In this essay , I will explain personal points which base on previous examples as well as specific reasons .  Firstly , Yong people spend much more time than old peole in entertainment aspect , such as TV , computer games and sports . In one hand , yong peole is the major resouces of world entertainment industry . Old peole trend to stay in theri world , doing theri personal hobby which not prefer to communcate with each other . In the other hand , old people do n't have enough energy for enjoying lives due to theri age . However , the situation of young people is totally different , the have enough energy for playing outside and enjoy theri lives . They trend to play each other and communications .  Secondly , Yong people are much easier to accept fashion things than old peopele which are the base of enjoying lives . For example , Young people like playing outdoor with skateboards which are the newest fashion sports in the world . Old people can not accept this kind of sport due to security . Therefore , old people would not access this area of sporting for enjoying theri lives . The attitudes on new things are the majoy problems . So , old people trend to take simple and easy traditonal games in theri lives .  In addition , most of old people prefer staying at home rather than playing outdoors . However , yong peole choose outdoor activities as theri favourite . In current tome , outdoor activities are the main entertainment in the world . Thus , numerous old pelople who trend to staying at home with out outdoor activites will lose theri chances for enjoying theri lives significantly .  In conclusion , yong people like different types of entertainment and also accept more fashion things than old people . As a result of these situations , yong peole enjoying more life than old peole .	CHI
First of all I would like to state that there can never be given ` enough ' time to helping the local communities . Yet , by drawing comparisons between different communities all over the world I would like to present my home community in order to illustrate the youths ' commitment to their communities .  For my working definition I see ` helping communities ' as a willing and unpaid commitment in the local affairs . There is a huge amount of youth groups covering all ages and interests which meet once a week in order to pursue their common interests and aims . There is a range from choirs to play groups to sports clubs . By coming together they foster the community , some arrange public events like summer parties where everybody can take part and the profit is being donated to local institutions .  Additionally , many youths willingly become members of e.g. firemen to be able to safe their families and neighbours when required . Weekly meetings and trainings prepare them for this task . Moreover there are many who decide to be a social worker at least part-time , some even full-time for a whole year . They can work wherever they desire . Either they help in old peoples ' homes by taking them for a walk , doing their shoppings or simply spend time with them . Others decide to work with disabled people . Helping them to manage their daily lives . Some others prefer to work with young children who have problems at home or at school etc . There is a variety of possibilities where they can and do spend their time in order to improve the conditions .  Another possibility to get engaged in the community 's affairs is to get engaged in the local politics . Thus , young people 's ideas and suggestions can improve the community . For example I have just run a youths ' campaign which informed the citizens about and collected signatures against the bad conditions in our local kindergarden . Soon we achieved the necessary pressure to achieve our demand .	GER
Befor three years , i met with my frind who finished his university befror one month in that time and he was very sad because he did n't find a job in any company . When i aske him about the reason for that and he had gotten an exellent marks , he answerd that all comany want diffrent of skills in the emploee who will work with them . It is better to have broad knowledge to get a good job , big salery and high postion in any comany .  If you have diffrent major in you education or several of knowledge you 'll have a big chanse to get agood job . For example , if you have engneering major withe some courses in coputer , you 'll get job faster then if you have just an engneering . Also , you 'll work in a diffrent department and that wiil make your job more exciting .  It 's not hard to get a job , but to have a good salery is the hard thing . To improve your skills snd to get a nice salery you should diffrent then the outher eployee . Alot of people try to get one major in teir education and ther want to work , if you want to be diffrent then the outher you have to get5 broud of knowledge .  Not every one can be a manager or importent one in his company . The manger has a special proparties then the outher , more education and strong behavior . We can get the diffrent education by having broad of knowledge . If you study difrrent major with diffrent of people you 'll get the strong behavior .  In cnclusion , you can be an Importent man with big salery in an exellent job if you have broad of knowledge and diffrent of education . My frivs also have knowen that .	ARA
I agree the opinion . It 's because I have really experienced such cases . I love a model of the fashion magagine . Besides , if she wears something cloth , it encourages me to buy the same one , only by seeing the shot . However , actually when I visit the shop of the cloth , it does n't suit me at all . Some of my friends said to me that they have experienced such as me . Therefore , like this , it is common for advertisements to seem much better than they really are . We can say in other occasion .  Like my experience , people is easily made to want products that popular and famous people for example , artists , models , actors or actoress , used . Companies use this method . Therefore , today , we can see advertisements in many cases . These are commercials in television or radio , on newspapers or magagines and finally even in trains or buses .  Take an example on online shopping on TV . The buyer shows us his/her pleasure after using the products on the screen . Or , the clerks or famous actors appear on the screen , then they insist that the products be good . Then , people that saw the TV program make their minds into buying the product . Until we touch the product directly , we do n't know whether the comment on the screen is true or not .  Besides , the clerks emphasizes that the product is cheap , or with some presents only now . It is the way of showing good by the clerks . So , the more effectivelly they introduce the product , the more people want to buy it .  Therefore , I agree with the statement .	JPN
The density of cars in the world is increasing dramatically each year . As far as I know , there are no reasons to think that this tendency is going to change in the next twenty years . Specially , if we have in consideration different factors such as : the economic growth of countries like China or India that will allow its population to buy more cars , the general reduction of car prices ( specially due to competition existing betwen american and asian manufacturers ) or the quality of the existing cars ( that will allow its use during a longer period ) . Finally , we ca n't ignore the fact that more infrastructures are being built all around the world in order to absorve the expected increase of the number of cars .  Althoug it is true that the number cars existing in western markests will increase softly , the BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) are undeveloped markets , where the number of cars will increase dramatically .  On the other hand , prices of the cars are being reduced because of the tremendous effort done by American and Asian producers in order to lead the world market .  All the above supported by the effort done by all the governments on building new and faster higways .  In conclusion , for the above mentioned reasons , the number of cars existing in the world will be increase in the next generations , despite environmental an oil problems .  it uilt in order to absorve an important increase in the number of cars provide better hicars will be safer , more economic and more population	SPA
It is difficult for me to answer this question , because we must define some concepts to answer this question . First of all what is really meant by using the word `` nowadays '' . Comparing young people from now and those who have lived fifty years ago is not the same as comparing them to those who have lived a century ago . Let me suppose we are comparing nowadays young people to those who were young just at the end of the Second World War . For that example it is difficult to answer again for a particular reason that is that the society was not the same at that time . The cities were not so crowded , excepted for a few of them , and then several people used to live in small cities . In that kind of town the people are more likely to know each other than in the big city centres . When you live in a small town you can for example help your neighboor with his garden when he is not at home and you are more likely to do that kind of thing just because you know very well . In the cities almost nobody know his neighboor .  A second thing that has to be clarified is the meaning of `` helping their communities '' . Must there be a benefit for every body or just for a single person ? The action that benefit all the community are so easy to do for young people just because they do not care about that at their age .  To finish I would like to give a part of my opinion on this suject . I would say that the young people nowadays give less time that their parents used to do in the past , but to my mind this is not due to their selfishness but to the today society 's selfishness .	FRE
I absolutely agree whit the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their comunities because they have other worries in life and do not have more time to be involved with their community .  Nowadays young people has many other worries and does not have time to spend for their community . This problems are that some youngers while are studying they have to work in order to pay their studies . Other youngers have problems with money and as nowadays life is very expensive they have to work so many hours in order to go on with everything . And if we talk about youngers that have already children , it is not viable . For instance , I am 27 years old and I finished my degree and now I would like to do a postgraduated program overseas in order to improve my professional skills and knowledges . In order to do that now I have to spend most of my time working so many hours so I will be able to carry on with my studies . Not only I have to worry for my studies but for my flat , the bills , the rent . And in a few years I would like to have a child . Eventhough this pitty situation I would really like to have a little of time helping my cummunity but since the rythm of life goes so fast I think that it is impossible at least at the moment .  As life goes so fast in my opinion I understand that young people nowadays have so many problems to spend helping their communities . Maybe if the rythm changes things will go better and	SPA
Every people enjoy to do different things . Some of they thing reading is the most enjoyed thing on the world but the otherside some of them think hanging out with friends is the most enjoying thing ot the world . Going outside more , playing some games or living life little bit faster than other people does n't make life to more enjoying .  Go to the disco or playing to the computer maybe able to make life enoying for some young people but the same time it cound be very boring for older people .  Usually older people like to quite place . They enyoj to do reading book or newspaper , gardening or that kind of relaxing and enjoying works . Some times Grandparents and grandchildren go to vacation at summer time together . Usually grandchildren go to pool or beach and swim all day or play something with their friends . Grandparents usually stay at home or hotel and they spent their time relaxing . It doens't mean they are not enyoj . It is not just about they like or not like . the other side their body need to be relaxing . so they chose these way and when they relax they could be happy . When the young people see old people relaxing or doing nothing they think older people are not enyoj life like them . But it is not true .  There is a different examples . These days teenagers spend most of their time on computer , internet or tv . They sitting all they in the same room and they just looking some unreal vision on the screen . And older people said that it is boring to spent all their they in fornt of the screen but if you ask the young people it is lot of fun .  Everybody like to do different things . The fact is if you do the things which you really like your life is enjoying . Doens't matter what the other poeple thing about that or how it is seen . The important thing is you like it .	TUR
Traveling is one of the good opportunities to get to know the outside world , so I strongly oppose to this statement . I think we can discover new things more by traveling alone or with few friends or family .  Firstly , we can be flexible with our scedule when we travel ourselves . This means we can pick places we want to go and arrange the most effective rout . When I went to Spain with my son last month , we picked where we wanted to go first and organized our rout carefully . We moved around using a subway and visited historical sites and museums . Whenever we felt like changing our plan , we had a cup of coffe and made another plan . For example , after we saw Gaudi 's famous Cathedral in Barcerona , my son wantted to visit other architectures of his , so we decided to see other buildings rather than go to Picaso museum .  Secondly , we can go where our interests are . In Granada , we visited an old historical town called Albishin . This town is located on the hill and it seemed to be very difficult for tour groups to go , as these roads are too narrow for large buses to drive and there are many passes to get out of the town . If I were a tour guide , I might lose my customer as these roads are like a huge maze . But when I think back our trip , this town was the most exciting and attractive place for us . If we had gone to Spain in a group tour , we could not have visited this marvelous historical town .  For these reasos , I prefer traveling on my own or with few people . We can go where we really want to go and enjoy what we really want to see . The Spain trip with my son became one of the most memorable trips for me .	JPN
How would you react if an adult tells you that he was more happy when he was a child ? Does it mean that becoming an adult , dissipate happiness and good times ? According to my own experience , i think that people were getting happier when they were children . They just live how there mind guide them trough without thinking about consequences .  Firstly , I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about anything materials . They live their life without thinking about the consequences . Indeed , everything they wanted to do is possible , so they just have to realise what their hearts tell them to do . People are used to say that mankind are lead by money and interest , contrary to children who are only guide trough life by happiness and pleasure . For example a young boy does not care about what his mum is doing . But her mum must take care of her baby , and she has to safe ihim and protect him from dangers .  we can also say that young people are in good heealth that able them to live their life without money problems , job problems and more . .. They spend most of their time playing with their friends without being disturbing .  According to my own experience , i can say that being a child is the best period of your life . You do not have to care about anything than just playing outside . You are not stress by your destiny and by the world around you . But saying that adults do not enjoy their life is wrong but it is a question of priority , yopu hqve less think to count of .	FRE
I totally agree with that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I have to specific reasons . First reason is that , It attracts through people 's desire and finally , they wants a product and it made peole are going to buy them . Of course , it 's most important thing to company as a process of business , they must have need to more profit . So , they should be able to the best to ornate the product in the advertisement . Generally , it has many problems because the following reasons . Almost all advertisement in TV or magazines and so on , to purpose to introduce a product for consummer , but they take only bright side of that . Furthermore , according to those of ads , every product does n't have any drawback and definitely perfect . However , it 's not real and that 's because why many advertisements are problem . The biggest problem is that many people who is see the advertisements believe it . It makes people spend their money to buy them . In my case , When I was see a cell After buying that , I realized it does n't need to me bet it In this sense , I agree with those of statement .	KOR
I believe that is very difficult to understand ideas and concepts and it is simpler and faster to learn facts . in my opinion , you can understand a fact without knowing ideas and concepts about it but you ca n't understand ideas if there are not fact and practical examples that support the idea !  It is difficult to understand ideas because they are made by other people with concepts and ways of thinking different from yours . And also , people have different ideas on different arguments , so is not possible to explain or to describe something in one way or in one idea , everyone can have various and different ideas .  Ideas can often be manipulated by people who want their idea to be dominant . A fact , to the contrary , ca n't be changed , it is the same for everybody and his evidence proves that it can not be change .  A fact can also be funny , scary , interesting . .. it can give an emotional impression which is easier to remember then an idea . If student learn facts , they can make connections between those facts and ideas and concepts that they already have . On my way of thinking , for example , learning fact is very important while one is studying history : when children learn history about Nazism and Holocaust , they ca n't understand the meaning of this words if they do n't know what happened , so , they ca n't understand if they do n't know the facts !  Tis could happen also in other subject like biology : concepts and idea are mad only after a fact has been observed ! Only after knowing facts it 's possible to figure out the meaning of the concepts . Ideas have to be supported by fact ! The first step and the more efficient way to learn is to know and learn facts .	ITA
The issue statement states that there will be a decline in the number of cars in the next twenty years . I strongly disagree with this statetement . Moreover i think that the number of cars being used is going to increase in the near future .  First reason i would like to give is that the cost of cars is going to decrease gradually . If you obsereve the past trend previously it used to be a luxury to possess a car . But now it has become a necessity . Also the cost of cars when compared to the past rates is very low now . Hoping that the the same trend continues in some 5 or 6 years even the common man will be able to afford a car . So everybody will be rushing to own a car and hence the number will rise exponentially .  Second thing is that cars are thought to be more safer when compared to other two wheelers . This feeling is gradually spreading in countries like india where the two wheelers dominate the roads . if this notion becomes stronger present two wheeler owners will replace them with cars and again the number of cars will increase .  Third idea is that cars can transport many people at a time when campared to bikes and scooters . so these bike or scooter owners also will be trying to purchase cars . Also as the prices of petroleum products are going to increase people will think of spending money on cars and have combined transportation rather than investing on individual tranportation means such as two-wheelers .  Last but not the least many people thik that owning a car is a kind of prestige issue . In this modern world where people are constantly trying to show off it wont be a surprise if more number of cars are purchased . Hence in the near future more number of cars are going to land on the roads throughout the world	TEL
Last summer , my wife and I were planning for our vacation , and after we selected the place where we wanted to go , she suggested that it 's better to travel in a group , and I agreed on that , and added that it 's best to have a group provided by a comprehensive plan for the trip , and a tour guide , since I consider this is the best way to travel , especially if I 'm going to a place that I do n't know .  Travelling has many benefits , the most important of which is knowledge . By travelling to a certain contry or island that I don ' t know anything about , I must come back with much information about it , otherwise my trip is useless . The best way to get information about the area which I want to travel to is to go in a group led by a tour guide , who will explain everything about the place : History , Value , Landmarks , and all the important details . I found the tour guide very useful in last summer when we ( my wife and me ) went to that Greek Island : Rhodes , which was like a museam in which we studied the Greek history . The amount of information we gained about that area of the world is so tremendous , and all that was because of that distinguished guide .  In addition to the assistance for getting the important information obtained from the guide , he is a great help in every other aspect of the travelling , like dealing with the people in the `` strange '' place , directing us to the greatest places that we must visit , and all the other daily life matters that without him , it could form a big issue or problem .  Finally , I consider the guide an essential element for a succesful trip , and he is indispensible for all the services that he can provide before , during , and even after the trip .	ARA
I do not agree with this statement . Today , technology is advancing with a breathtaking pace . Newer sources of energy are being pursued and more efficient ways of using resources are being researched on continually . The demand for transportation will always remain and people would always like to travel in their own personal space .  The most common fuel that is used for running cars is petroleum and this fuel will be in great scarcity and its demand will keep on increasing as years progress . People have already started switiching to other sources such as hybrid cars which provide a combination of electricity and fuel on which the car can run . Researchers and scientists are continually trying to harness the potential of hydrogen ( H ) which if successful , can be easily used to reduce any dependence on other fuels because of its abundance on earth .  Governments of various countries are making efforts to make the use of public transport such as public buses and trains more common . For example , in the United Arab Emirates , a huge project is presently under construction for the metro train . Various governments are trying to relieve the dependence of a commuter on cars . But , this does not mean that every single person is going to make use of the train or bus at all times .  Many people need to travel short or medium distances frequently throughout the day , pertaining to their job requirements . There are also people who do not like travel in public or need to travel in controlled atmospheres because of medical conditions . This category of people will always require that some sort of personal transportation be available which is also comfortable . This requirement can only be fulfilled be a vehicle such as a car .  Therefore , cars will always be there as a means of transportation and will definitely not decrease in number than what is present today . Various new sources are being developed and some may also be discovered by scientists and researchers . It is only a matter of time that something more efficient than petrol comes into picture and replace it .	HIN
As far as iam living in this planet , i can realize that industry and science are growing rapidly in two ways . One is for the benefit of the human being and one on the other hand is towards destroying him .  Well , talking about the one that is harming us . The increase in number of cars nowadays is actually making our lives more so complicated and difficult . For example , in Dubai , it needs a person to reach his office in the rush hours around two hours !  So the governments thought seriously about that issue and now is constructing a Sub way that can let you reach any place in the city within few minutes ! At that time i think so many cars will be sold because they are of no use .  And i think one of the most crowded cities in cars is London . And by the 2020 's people might get rid of their cars and go and buy bicycles .  Science after 20 years from now will be rapidly and increasingly progressed . And scientists might develope some kinds of cars that can fly with their own tracks that they can build over eachother so as to make use of space !!  Their might also be somekinds of motorcycles that are so sophisticated and secured that can alternate the use of cars . Well , by that time i hope that all countries will have developed ways so we can travel by the speed of light . So no gas , no pollution , more space and friendly planet .	ARA
there is no consensus among people as to the arguement that it is good for a group to travel led by a guide. with an increasing number of people claim that it has lots of disadvantages , some people mor e sensible tend to consider the nature that traveling with a guide is amazing . and the latter point coincides with mine for my reason below :  firstly , we never remain suspicious of the point that traving with a tour guide has an extremely affect on the mood of the memebers of the group . for instance , statistics indicate that 70 percentage of people who has the experence of traveling with a guide will have a good mood . another example , i often travel with my parents and we always travel with a guide . because of the professional knowleges the guide obtained , he can arrange our activity schedule , and we should not worry any thing , what we should do is just watching and engoy the chaming view passing by . so easy is the travel , we never feel tirde because we can focus our mood on the beatuty of view . so the trip become happy and easy without a thinking that where we should to go to , and where is the most famous place because we can obtain totally from the mouth of the guide . it is so cool . and the group member will have more time chating with each other .  furthermore , it is no exaggerating to say that traveling with a guide has huge influence not just on the mood we have , but on our money as well . for example , without a guide we are likely to buy some thing unuseful but attracting at that moment . however if a tour guide accompanies with your group , it will not be a matter . once our family went to qingdao which is a charming seashore town with chaming views that the seabirs are sing with sunshine . so we are attracted by it . when a men sell some sea food , we accept because at that moment we forget anything but the amazing view . at that time the guide stop us because he think the price of the seafood is too high . with his advice , we are awake . thus , thanks to his help . we save lots of many to buy something useful . therefore , traveling with guide has lots of benefits that can infulence us fanancially .  as we have discussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that traveling with a guide not only can help us obtain a good mood but can save our money as well . therefore , it is highly time that we should raise the public awareness of the significance of the guide , . just in this way can we get a wonderful journey with other group members .

In these days , college have many programes to offer for students . Each student has different opinion about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects thand to specialize in one specific subject . Personally , I think to have specialize in one specific subject can much achievment for the goal .  Fistly , if you learn many things academic subjects , you can not learn deeply . For instance , when I was high school student , I learned lot of things during the three years . I could not concentrated one subject because there are too much topic so , I can not find related each subject . Therefore , it does not help me to learn many subjects so , I prefer to learn just one subject . It can be more concentrate for me .  Secondly , in these days , we have specialize person for each division parts . When you know broad things and does not know specific about their subject , you can not do anything in our society . Many people do the best their own subject and they are become speciall person who knows really well about their own department . If you concentrated just one subject and learned lots of things , you can help people who wants to need to you . However , if you learned lots of subjects , you did not get specific lessons from that subjects .  Lastly , we do not have lots of time to learn everything during the life . We have lots of subject aroud us and if you choose one subject you should concentrated that because we do not have much of times to learn just one subject too . For example , I am nusing students so , I always think about care for patient and learned lots of things for patient . I do not have much of time to learn lots of subject because , I am not perfectly to learn whole one subject . One subjects has lots of things so , I decided learn only one things . When I all in the nusing , I can improve my care skills . Therefore , I will be a better nurse when I will graduated . I think , to concentrated one subject , can be make more specialize their own position .  To conclude , there are many subject in our life . Everyone wants to learn everthing but we can not learn everything because each subject has lots of material . In my opinion , learn to specialize in one specific subject is the better than have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because , if you concentrated just one subject , you can be learn lots of things deeply .

People always said that if you want to learn more about a unfamiliar city or place , just stop reading , making a trip there is a definite way to solve this problem . I do agree with this , but should we travel with a group by a tour gaide or just go there by ourselves ? I believe that the attitudes that people maintained to this question will be differ . I would rether say that I 'd like to go to a new place on my own .  First of all , it is hard to be denied that the goals of our travel is to feel and enjoy different cultures , in most part . I would say that I am a boy who like to adventure , because that is more exciting than going with a group . The cultures could be seen as a representation of a place , and also should be respected . If I get a great amount of knowledges about those culture from the tour guide , that will make me feel disappoint and those knowledges will becoming tedious and boring to me , the only way that I get to know a kind of new culture is to feel it by myself .  In addition , joining a group that led by a tour guide is seems freeless , because our journey is already projected by guide and the guide can even trying to convince us to by some expensive local crafts which can benefit the guide . That will make our trips unacceptable .  Forthermore , it is impossible that the travel with a group is cheap . If I go somewhere on my own , I will make a precise project to control my cost and I can even live in my friend 's home that beside that place I want to visit , which can not only cut down numorous money , but also let my trip have more wondeful feeling and more significant means .  As what I have mentioned above , I would rather say that I do like to travel a place on my own .	CHI
I agree to the statement that ' the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . The best reason to put forth is of the knowledge the guide has because he has been to the place earlier and knows a lot many things about the place . If I were to plan a trip with my friends the first thing to do would be to hire a guide .  Many reasons can be put forth for choosing a guide to help us through the trip , primary reason being his knowledge of local places . If I were to book a hotel I would n't know the pricing and also to get to places , hiring a transport could be a big problem . The guide comes in handy for he knows the most economical places to stay in and also these days we see guides getting into contracts with local drivers to help travellers have the option having their own transport to see the various places of visit . I have recently come across a travel arrangement company that has their own dedicated staff as a guide for helping the travellers have a memorable experience .  The guides being local to the place have a good knowledge of the local places of visit and would help us getting a good feel of the local culture by showing us the places that show the true local culture . Even there are places of eating where we can see the real taste of the place . These can be only be visited if have a person guiding us to these places . Often a guide is like a local friend helping us in staying at the best hotels at an economlical price , eating the best food , visiting the best places .  I would like to end the topic by stating that the guide is the best person who can make our visit exciting and helping us out in planning the trip with only a little monetary cost .	TEL
I 'm totaly agree with the statement because if the products seller make advertisements for their products it will effect of the product 's sells . For example , in my country some companies make cheap product but they advertises it like no one can make this product like us , we are the best . After that , they sell like a millions of it . Then some people get poision of that product because they use cheap things .  Also , In the US , some companies give an advertisement to a telvision channel like 10 times a day . They are making their product in Asia , because there is no handwork in there . So , they can make whatever they ca n't in US . Most countries do that , even though a person can make his or her product by himself or herself . Because they just print where the product made in .  However , people know advertisement is a way to intorduce to sell . So , people could decide either buy it or not . If the producters make their advertisement well , everybody will be agree that the product sell very well . A person can recognize that a product is most powerful or harmful . People should get the idea of the advertisement , if they do n't they can feel like `` What was that advertisement all about ? '' . So the person will be complicated .  Finally , If producters want to sell too much , they should make them good . Also they should n't use cheap things . sda asd as asd asd as fsdag ntr rngkj uiy h bby ni ulk	TUR
Spending time on a holiday tour is the best way to relax oneself from the stress and pressures of work in such a competitive world . People with lots of time in hand for planning and scheduling tours prefer to travel on their own , but I personally prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .  A complete tour pakage reduces my tension of flight confirmation , booking of hotels in cities not known to me and also the head ache of researching about the places that I am going to visit . Also , I get a chance to meet many interesting people and make new friends from different walks of life which also makes the tour even more exciting and interesting . It takes care of my spendings as I can budget my trip well allocating appropriately to shopping and other needs and it also saves me from getting cheated in foreign land .  I can visit all the important places of the cities and the guide would help as in knowing about the importance and significance of the places better . In addition , I could be more involved in the group while travelling which would help me in communicating to a variety of people and enhance my knowlegde horizon socially as well as give me a chance to learn about different minds . The guide would also personally help in finding happening and other interesting places of the cities which are not the part of the schedule . It would also help in time management as we have to adhere to the timings scheduled by the tour guide . Moreover , touring in a group would take take of my personal safety from local residents and their misbehaviour , if any .  In conclusion , I would certainly like to travel in a group captained by a tour guide a I dont have to bother about booking tickets for travelling , staying as well as personal safety .	HIN
Of course , students have to learn facts from teachers and memolize them . However , it is only a first step to proceed their study . They should spend most of time to figure out ideas and concepts . By doing this , they can acquire appication skills . Moreover , they can enjoy their studies .  To begin with , they can get highly developed appication skills if they try to understand matters . You will agree with this idea : person who knows the nature of matter can perform well when he works on new problems , rather than person who only memolized surface of the matter . They can applicate their ideas if they know the matter deeply . Now , it is often said that Japanese lack the appication skill . We are ranked in a lower position when the research is out . In contrast , countries , like US , are ranked higly every time . We know the cause of this situation . The education of Japan higly emphasizes memolizing . We must take hard entrance examination when we enroll in high school and university . So , although we often memolize the facts , we seldom have opportunity to think the matter deeply . So , students can raise their appication skill by understanding the concept itself .  Second , understanding the nature of problems is much more attractive for students . They can get pleasure when they find out the solution or they could understand the concept . Therefore , they can continue studying with joyful . We want to do what we like rather than dislike . It also helps raising their accademic skills . In contrast , in case of learing all things , they will stop studying . For me personally , I did n't like studying at all until I entered university . I could not find joy in studying because I had to memolize many facts . However , almost all studies in universities assign us to think by ourselves . Now , studying is not disconfort .  Because of the application skills and joyment , I believe students should concentrate on understanding . They can raise their ability and become interested in studying more .	JPN
The life change more confortable and easy to live , and also the price of car decrease . The people prefer to buy and use their own car then to use bus or subway .  So , some people can think the car will be more and more in the future , but I disagree that `` In the twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .  First of all , the peple will rethink the pollution , so they will decrease to use the their car . As you know that the car is reson of the pollution , and people use the more and more then pollution also getting worse and worse , because of carbon dioxide which is from the car , and other bad gas . So people will decrese to use the car .  Secondry , when all people use the car , this things will make trafic jam problems , so people always live in the road , and they can not do what they want to do on time . So they will prefer other trafic such as bus and subway , because those go faster than the car .  Thirdly , it will be obvious anyway the people always die even the medical is developing . And the future there are too many people that do not get married and have the baby , so there is just few increasing people . Hence it is not different from the now .  Hence , people will not use more the car in the future than rutine . because people always think their enviroment than their confortable . And also they do not want to late all their appointment .

It is common that many people begin to gain knowledge in a variety of ways . At the same time the question that if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject will be brought about . What do you think of the issue ? As far as I am concerned , I will agree with the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . In the following paragraphs , I will add some examples and details to support my point of view .  In the first place , specializing in one specific subject has advantages in various ways , of which , the most significant is that it will save our time and energy . We have to the point out the essencial fact that we do not have enough time to finish every work well , which means that we can not do good in many academic subjects . If we focus on one subject , we are able to spend enough time on that subject . Therefore , we will have more chances to be successful in the subject we concentrate on . For instance , if a student whose major is computer science studies art to broaden his eyesight , he will not have much time study his major , which will influence his grades and credits . As a result , there will be bad effects on his study . In consequence , we will make good use of our limited time to study , if we concentrate on one subject .  In the second place , what is also worth noticing is that it will bring benefits to our future job , if we specialize on one specific subject . As we all know , in the future we will find a job which we are interested in . In that case , we should focus on one subject which attracts us a lot . Then we will find a good job after graduation because of our professional knowledge . For instance , if we study biology , we are able to learn more in the subject , which means that we can gain the knowledge related to biology . Therefore , when we have the interview , we will have a lot of academic knowledge to be discussed which will leave a good impression to the manager . We will get the job we want easily .  Admittedly , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we will become knowledgeable . However , if we have knowledge in a variety of aspects and we do not know much about each subject , it will cause bad influences on our future life , which is not good . Therefore I tend to hold the opinion that it is better to specialize on one subject which we have lots of interests and we will get benefits from it .  To sum up , taking into account of what has been discussed above , I can draw the conclusion that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects . I wish that there will be an increasing number of people who can get benefits from the one subject they specialize in .	CHI
I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . There are two reasons as follow .  First of all , most people would agree that the products in the advertisement are presented under the best circumstances since the purpose of advertisement is to sell the products . For example , clothing manufacturers and designers put their clothes on good looking models which makes clothes more attractive . Another example can be food advertisement . Food is presented in the best dishes with picture perfect lightening and everything . I remember that I had to return some of the products I bought because they were different from what I had seen on the Ads .  Secondly , advertisement is one of the most powerful ways for producers to communnicate and convince people that their products are benefitial to cutomers , Therefore , people tend to emphasize the strengths of the products rather than showing their shortcomings unless they are legally asked to do . For example , when we listen to TV or radio commercial such as cosmetic items , we feel like that items can be solution to all of our skin problem . The ad does not say how time or money consuming the products can be . That is , I think , one of the reasons that certain products such as cigarettes or sleeping pills are required to state the possible side effects . Unless the law requires , companies would not want to show their shortcomings .  As I stated above , advertisements are used to promote the slaes and communicate with cumstomers and viewers in favor of the products . Consequently , I am truly convinced that products are better projected in advertisements than they are in reality in most cases .	KOR
I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . Having more knowledge could broaden ones horizon ; serve as a parth to discover ones true passion ; gain help with talking to other people and be capable of understanding the world around us .  Firstly , having more knowing of many academic subject areas could broden our horizons because we know different subjects in different fields . Each specific subject has its own uniquness , therefore it would be better to know a bit about each areas .  Secondly , understanding more knowledge could serve as a path for people to discover their ` real ' passion . Sometimes if we are always ` inside the box ' , it would be hard for us to find other hobbies and have the oppurtunity to think whether it was truly their passion or not . When I was in Grade 11 , I studied courses in different areas , such as Chemistry , Accounting , Physical Education , Business , History etc . I wans't sure of what I wanted to study in university , and I do n't want to limit my area of study , therefore I decided to broaden my knowledg by taking many acdemic subjects . However my friend , whom desperately wanted to become a doctor , took all science courses , because she had discovered her passion . As a result , I think it would be better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects before specializing one , unless you have found something that you really love doing .  Moreover , by understanding more subjects , it would be easier for people to engage in conversations with new people . Everyone have different backgrounds , therefore if you have knowledge from different areas , it could be easier to socialize with people whom have different fields than you do . A way of knowing more subjects is to read every section of the newspaper such as Businss , World , Entertainment etc . This could help one to know more knowledge and therefore be more talkative when meeting new people .  Since the world changes everyday , everyday something new will happen . If we do n't have the basic background towards a certain subject , we will not be able to understand it . Moreover , a lot of subjects are inter-related , therefore you will need knowledge from other areas in order to fully understand the material . For example , business ties with politics , political changes could affect the business environment , therefore it is essential for us to have a simple background of politics in order to understand business changes around the world .  In conclusion , with all the reasons stated above , I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .	CHI
While a large number of students realize that understanding the ideas and concepts are the basis of a learning process , I tend to believe that learning facts is more important .  First , the facts let the students know the implementation and design based on the abstract ieads and concepts on the textbook . A student who conducts and manages a software development team may have deeper understanding over the area of software design and human resource management than the one who only learn from the books . For example , a designer may have more detailed and deepened comprehension of the internal core thinking , which is the most valuable part in his job , after he finishes a design by researching and review a lot of books and articles including concepts proposed before .  In addition , it makes more sense for a student to learn the facts brought by his or her own hand-on experiment . When I was a member in the web development team of our university website , I learned a lot from the practice of installing and configuring the web server and writing code for a web application , which is not fully stated on any book in the book store . This makes my way more broad and easier to go to achieve expertise on the field of conputer science .  Lastly , learning facts is a higher level that just understanding the original ideas and concepts . The students who knows how to put the principles into the daily work may show a stronger ability to master not only what to learn but also how to learn , that is to say , they are more likely to become a quick learner , an ability which is called for by many international business companies such as Microsoft , Google and IBM .  From all the discussion I mentioned above , we could safely draw a conclusion that learning facts takes a more significant position that just understanding the ideas and concepts in the learning process .

There are many reasons why the number of cars in use today will not stop increasing in the future . Just judging from the way cars have become more and more popular and common over the past tweny years it is unlikely to expect a sudden change in that area .  Another point supporting that theory certainly is that cars have become more affordable for everyone and also very easy accessable for young people . Most people in The United States of America posess their first own car bz the age of sixteen .  Another problem that in my opinion is directly linked to the number of cars and that we are facing today is the problem of obesety in sociey . In most developped countries peolpe are getting bigger and bigger , become more and more lazy and therefore more likely to drive a car . Simplz because it is more convenient .  Then again , people are also starting to be aware of the direct link between cars and the effect they have on environmental changes . Some strongly object to the idea of having a car because they simply can not live withe the thought of destroying the planet out of egoistic purposes .  In a television transmission that i happened to watch a few days ago i also heard a discussion about tha earth running out of natural sources such as oil . If there is no more oil we will have a huge problem supplying our cars . Although that is not expected to happen anytime soon scientists are trying to find alternative by developping more natural and environment friendly ways to make an engine work .  But I believe that this will take a huge amount of time and not be presented to the public in the next years . So , no , i do not believe that there will be less cars in 20 years	GER
yes i agree with statement . Because young people are at stage of the life . so , this people will enjoy alot compare to old people . whereas old people enjoyed at that age but not now .  But , nowadays young people enjoy more than old people enjoyed . Reasons are : young people are in good health and they are very flexible to any kind of environment . As they are younger naturally they are in a position to do any thing like playing , dancing , drinking . whereas old people can do all this thing , no it is not possible .  young people wil enjoy with friends going with friends and spendingf time with friends in chating , etc. , roming here and there . Enjoying the holidays in othere country with friends , parties . where as coming to old people they can not move any were because , as they become old there health will not support to move to the other places or the environment doestnot suite there health . They could not enjoy at this age .  Coming to the young people they can adjust anywere , they can do any thing because until there body permits . young people will enjoy alot compare to the old people because there are lot many changes in present days compare to previous days . keeping present days in view we can say that young peoplle will enjoy many things .  Young people will enjoy by attending parties and coming late nights to house or going for a lomg ride , going with friends for picnic . enjoying weekend parties with friends or official parties etc. enjoying all the taste and entering into each and every corner to taste the thing or to no about the place . if they found a new place they will reach there and they enjoy re they know about thaty place .  Hence i conclude that young people will enjoy more than old people by saying above reasons and with examples .	TEL
The statements of quality of products is a complex and controversial issue . While some people argue that advertisments do n't give the real quality of product , other people think that they know what they buy . So , advertisements can not influenced their choice .  Both perspectives are importants , but overall , I desagree with the statement that advertising influences my choice .  My point of view is important because we overall know the differents products we use for ourselves . As an example , when you want to buy a car , you use specifics informations about the type of car you want and do n't follow necessarily advertising provide by any car company .  Secondly , advertisements are not firstly directed to influence the choice of custommers . It is highly used by company for settle their leadership ( best selling ) . This can be illustrated by the fact that when someone want a specific car , he has the choice between sometimes more than one company .  Some people can object that , young boy are mostly influence by advertising . This objection can be countered by the fact that they are not responsible for their purchases . When they want something , they ask their parents to buy it for them . And overall , the parents do n't follow thre desire of their children because they know what is important for them or not .  While the issue of quality of products must be considered carefully , the fact that we know what we want compoumded with the object of the company to settle at a leadership place produce convincing why I desagree whith the following statemement : ** Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are **	FRE
Students meet many kinds of information in their courses or lectures . It can be regarded as an information overload on students . The lectures usually include ideas , concepts and facts which students should learn and use . I assert that students should try to understand ideas and concepts instead of facts in the lessons in order to be successful . Understanding of ideas and concepts rather than facts offers knowledge which is more lasting and provides students with deep and total understanding of topics .  First of all , a students has two choices , when he or she is studying on a lesson ; memorizing the facts which are included in the subject or understanding the main concepts and ideas which are covered in the subject . If he or she prefers memorizing to understanding , his or her knowledge will be lost after some days later . Because of the reason , covering the ideas and concepts is more useful and helpful than learning the facts .  The other important advantageous of understanding ideas and concepts is deep and total understing of the subject . The ideas and concepts have more meaning than facts . In other words , they are more valuable in terms of the meaning . On the other hand , facts may be just case or specific situation . It is narrow and has generally meaning about itself . It seems that ideas and concepts should taken interests than facts by the students .  To conclude , it is the students ' preferences whether he or she pays more attention on ideas and concepts in the subject or not . The other choice is memorizing facts in the subjects . Understanding ideas and concepts is more lasting and provides students with deep and total understanding . After considering the two advantageous of ideas and concepts , which mentioned before , they are enough to prove its importance .	TUR
Some people like trying new things and take risks . By contrast , other people always do what they already know well . there are some advantages and disadvantages to both ways . However , I believe the saying : `` No pain , no gain '' . Trying new things and taking risks are worth doing .  First of all , succes comes from innovaton and risk . History shows that only brave and creative people have made impact on human life . For instance , Thomas Edison invented light bulbs . During his work , he tried thounsand kinds of materials . He did not succeed until he found last one . In fact , he was not sure if he would find the right material all the way throgh . He took more risks than others could bear to . As a result , his courage and perseverance has changed our life .  Secondly , people are scared to try is because they are afraid to fail . Nevertheless , failure is the mother of success . Even though after all the hard work they may fail , the experience they acquire is valueless . The new gained precious experience will in turn lead them toward to their destiny . This is a common process to success . Without trying , this process will never happen .  Thirdly , staying where one is will eventually make him fall behind . In the 21st Century , everyone is trying to overcome any adversary to achieve their goals . If someone stops progress and does what he already knows how to do , he will be left behind . Therefore , taking risks and breaknig the mold is the only way to survive in this competitive society .  Overall , in one 's success and victory , trying new things and taking risks are the two vital factors . As people try to advance , the ones who stays the same are determined to be the last ones of the race in life . Only improvement brings a eternal success to a person .	CHI
I agree that in twenty years , advancement in convenience of public transport and/or concerns for the environment will decrease the number of cars in use than there are today . Public transportation will prove to be more efficient than owning a private car . Not only does is save money , but it also saves time . Using public trasportation will save money in two ways . Firstly , the expenses on fuel would be cut to zero . Secondly , one no longer has to spend money in car maintenance . Adding to that , using public transportation will also save time because there will be less traffic . This is proved especially true in subways . Because of these increase of benefits in using public transportation as technology advances , the population who would prefer owning a car would dwindle .  Another reason that the number of cars are going to decrease is that there are growing concerns for the environment . Environmentalists have been active in promoting the conservation of nature through media . They have successfully managed to alert the world about the seriousness of global warming and have also educated society on ways to prevent a serious disaster . These same Environamentalists have convinced many that preservation of nature is highly urgent . Also , they have stated that the earth will run dry on fuel in a few years . Thus , increasing amounts of people who abide to such beliefs will result in the decrease of car usage .  In conclusion , because of the effectiveness of public transportation and concerns for perserving nature , less and less poeple would be willing to own cars . When public transportation saves money and time compared to owning a personal car and when the earth can be subject to serious catastrophe because of your use of cars , could you possibly purchase a car ?

If people have to try new things , in order to become successful , depends on the kind of success of those people . For me it is clear that people have to take risks , in order to achive there goals , if they start a new business . Pushing the own company to success , is not just related with hard work , but also with the ability to take risks . Going new ways has many advantages . For instance , the company has less competition . In addition , the costumer 's are usually open for new ideas and product 's . Thus , going new way in combination with hard work , could lead to the desired goal .  Moreover , one imagine an enterprenuer who is willing to achive success in a businees , just by hard work and an old idea . It is clear tha he will stand against a huge competi On the other hand , if the person is employed , it could be more efficient to just consentrate on the things which he can do well and what is requiered in his position . In fact , person 's who consentrate on there abilities and push them furthermore , are more likely to become promoted then employees who are often trying new things . However , since promotion is the most important thing in an employees life , I disagree with the above mentioned statment .  In addition , people who wa n't to get in power , even in a multinational company , would go better , if they learn the structure of the company well , instead of greating it new .  In summ , it could be said that success is for different people different . Nevertheless , to be successful , people have to be aware of many aspects . In addition they must have a varity of abilities , but for each business there are other rules .	GER
I firmly believe that exist any men 's finest hour , and I am not able to say if it comes in early or latest period of our lives . Generally I think that a men 's finest hour comes when he worked hard for years and years , to finally discover that he was right in his life and so was the things he had worked to , and this discovering happens when he finally lies on his battlefield , exhausted , but victorious . Homer said that men become more tired of drinking , dancing and making love , than making war : so he would say that men are always in war , and only the dead saw the end of it , not because their are bad or barbarians , but because they enjoy to live their life on the edge , to take match every day , to demonstrate they are victorious . I think this is the meaning of `` enjoy life '' : to take part every day in new competitions , going away victoriuos , in the end . Now , I 'm not able to say when occours our best hour , it may happens when we 're old or when we are young , the meaning thing is enjoy this moment . Young boy , probably , live their lives and do n't think too much at the far future , when they will be old , like De'Medici said in his poems . Opposite this arguments , we can say that old people have a heavy bag full of cultural notions and experience , and they think much more at the thing they have to do , careing not only to themselves , but to all the people they have around and with have relationships . In ancient times they said : `` Only the good die young '' , but this thinking was strictly joined to a pagan vision of the world and life . Now is the coulture of the christians that found its way to rule the world , and we can say that we have not only a heroic youngness , but also a respectable middle or old age : this period of life is not yet rated like the autumn .  We can enjoy life in every period of our life at the same matter , it do n't care how much years you carry on .	ITA
In my opinion in order to have a better understanding of ideas , concepts must be supported by facts .  First of all it is impossible to understand an idea without a complete evaluation of the facts that are the base structure of the concept . If you understand an idea without knowing the facts behind it , then you are only learning a `` dogma '' . An example of dogmatic understanding is the religious one that ignores fact , because is not looking for a deep understanding of things but only to a solution that will bring to its answer .  This is why in religious learning , facts are generally avoided : they do prefer interpretations .  Second of all , to understand something you need to start learning the facts in order to start a critical analisys . The only way to start this process of understanding is starting from the knowledge of facts .  In order to understand an idea you must know what was the historycal situation in which this idea was created . I 'll make an example in order to make my opinion clearer : you ca n't understand the basic ideas of comunism or nazism without knowing the historycal situation and dynamics that brought to these different political , social and economical totalitarisms .  At last , I would say that you do n't really understand anything if you ca n't prove it and explain it with facts . Is with an empiric analisys of facts that you can prove what you have understood and why you believe so . Every scientist needs an experiment to clear his point , otherwise he will seem not credible and his idea not effective .  These are the three reasons why I believe that there is a strong link and connection between understanding an idea and learning the facts related to the concept .	ITA
Advertisement is the most important item and vehicle of the marketing . Therefore the producers desire to have the most attractive one for their products . However this can cause some misunderstandings for the consumers since most of the advertisements show products better than . This essay will state the cheating way of the advertisement and try to find a solution against it .  It is obvious that , most of the people have faced a problem with one of the producs they purchased , since the advertisements only focus on the positive ways of the product . None of the advertisements states the negative approaches of the products that they try to market . Moreover , owing to the competition , the producers try to not announce the all instructions of the product througth the advertisements since a well informed consumer may change her mind and buy an another one . In addition , due to the improvements in computer technology consumers are being attracted by the visional effects by the sector , hence they assume that the product is suitable for them or the product is as good as the advertisement .  In conclusion , most advertisements take an unfair position in favor of the product . Although the advertisement sector should be improved , this does not mean to have a right to breach the rights of the consumers and the other producers that try to compete in the market . Because of this situation the competition and consumer boards of thw countries have to control the advertisements and the consumers must be informed about their legal rigths against the producers .

I disagree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students . Actually from my point of view , facts are the same important just as ideas and concepts .  First , without facts , how come the ideas and concepts ? Ideas and concepts can not be separated from facts . For example , when we learn the concept of force in physics , students need to do experiments to be aware of the fact that there are different kinds of force everywhere in the world . The teacher will confuse the students if he or she just draw a simbol and point it to them , then say `` Look , it is what we call force '' . By doing this , the teacher is at the rick of being fired .  Second , students should not just get the ideas and the concepts but also know the detail facts in order to pass the exams . For example , in a exam of a biological course , students should remember the exact examples of animals in order to describe the progress of reproduction . I can not image a person can write down all the materials the teacher want without any facts . Although there may some exams which allowed students to take books with them , remembering the exact facts benifits the students pretty much , because ttey can save the time spent on referring to the books .  Third , students should learn facts in order to find a good job in some cases . For example , I major in computer science and it involves a lot of programming . The mathematical concepts and ideas do help me learn theories of computer . However , It is the time when I tried to find a job that I realized that facts such as the parameters of the computers do me a big favor to find a job as a programmer .  In conclution , while ideas and concepts are important in learning , facts are of the same weight to students .	CHI
Very often , people who managed to succeed in life like to discover new things , new areas in which they can try to succeed or master as well , all for the purpose of always aiming higher . The problem with this approche , is that it involves taking many risks , and at the end these people could end up loosing evrything , while they could have stick to what they already knew . This creates the problem of knowing if it is worth taking the risk to try new things or if instead people should stay with what they already posesse .  In my opinion , life is all about taking risks , and discovering new things , so that our knowledge does n't stay confined to what we already are good at , but that insted , these limits extand and allow us to learn and to succeed at new things . For example , if there were n't people willing to try to undertsand the anatomy of the human body , the progress in medecine would not have been so advanced as it is today . This shows that even if there are risks involved with gaining knowledge and mastering an area , it is still something that has to be done in order to evolve .  However , there are some times when people who take risks end up regretting it , wether because they did n't succeed in the other things they tried to learn and lost what they already possessed , or because they did n't like what they learn while exploring new areas . If we take for example a man who owns a show company , and he decides to invest his money in a new parfume company , or in another random business that does n't relate to his are of expertise , he may end up lossing money if this business doe n't work well , or he may end up giving up because this business is not fit for him . Either way , this man would have lost money and this could even affect the business in which he succeeded . Therefore , taking these risks could definitly end up causing these people a lot of harm , if they werent prepared for it .  In the end , it is all about beeing lucky and hoping for the best , because there is a lot of good things that can come out of discovering new things , but there are also bad things . But if i had to choose , i would probably decide to take the risks , because the world would n't be were it is today without our will to discover and to master .	FRE
Parents always say that you have to work very hard at your younger age , so as to enjoy your older age . I do n't think that this is a valid deal cause I dont think that I will be able to enjoy more in my older days than when I am young . Cause at older age you would like to settle down in a calm village and enjoy the peaceful and pleasant climate rather than living in a crowded city , with lot of things happening around you and that interests you .  At your younger age , you will have the energy to go around different places and view some of the beautiful creations in the world . But when you become old , maybe your health will not allow you to do adventures . At your younger age , you have many things to enjoy because of less responsibilities and more energy . At young age you can also have a great enjoyment with your romantic life too . Enjoying to the highest at your younger age and also working hard to get settled in the future is my moto of life . Normally people think that they will enjoy there life after they are old and they only work . But this can be harmfull if they dont get a chance to enjoy at thier older stage after so many years of hardwork .  Normally youngsters do enjoy a lot by arranging disco parties and trips to different locations with friends . They get in touch with the latest technologies and gadgets like ipods , mobile phones , games and many more . They do spend a luxurious life . Youngsters also enjoy sports and have a abilitiy to take part in it .  So finally I can say that , young people enjoy more than older people with respect to health , responsibilties , technology and much more . So , I prefer enjoying my younger age and getting settled in my older age .	TEL
I agree with this statement . The publicities and advertisements find to convinced people in every way about their products also these are false . This is no wrong with the people beacuse the effects of the products can also be dangerous even if the products are painted as the most beatiful exists in the world .  This type of advertisements are most important specifically for medicine and cosmetics products that can be caused very important problem . There are so many cases of intossications . For example , the dietetic products are more difficult that really help you , but using nice words and false tests , they can be convinced people to take . Also technology products . Design and beautiful colours used to distract people on the very important aspects like the processors , hardware , ram ect . .. People are attracted by the colours that see and the nice words that listen .  Stay on the people 's capacity and attention to understand what is true and right that can only help them . For money all people may say and do wrong and false things . Another reason for this comportament is the success much legated with money . We are so many conditionins about the advertisements and this is so wrong . We must learn to read the tickets on the products and certified that all the things writed are right , asking and doing some researches , and we must research the way to conviced people do n't buyed if they are not sure .

I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  The phenomenon appears in a lot of different categories , but one of the most import ones is business . Success is often related with money , which means , that a well know company would take more risk than a small family business . That is not completly true since one has to remember that the opportunities of a big company are much higher becuase they have the financial resources . But if one compares a successful company with an unsuccesful company one will see that the the compay with a high profit is risking more than the other one .  For example , Coca Cola is nowadays one of the most successful companies in the world . But it did not start form the beginning as a big company . It started with only one product called Cola . When Coca Cola was establish on the world market the Coca Cola company raised its porfit each year . After that the Coca Cola company took a huge leap of faith a invested in a new produced called Fanta and Sprite . That was very risky because the people might not like the new drinks and would not buy them so that the Cocal Cola company would not get back their production cost . But even if they would have lost all the money they invested into the new produvct the Coca Cola company had remaind as a successful company .  In general , successful business take more often risks to gain even more porfit rather than unsuccessful buisness because it does not matter to them if they loose .	GER
There are two reasons why the amount of cars used by people would be reduced in the future . The first reason is that people would take environment under concideration alot more than they do now . Another reason is that economical status may be effected toward the worse in the future .  people would appreciate good and healthy environment more in the future because of the fact that it is rapidly changing to the worse now . If we looked to the earth as a creature it would not be in a good health ; it would be `` ill '' and it wont take people long time to notice that , and as soon as they do and as soon as this fact shocks them back to their sence , they would be acting in a more responsible ways and will take emmediate actoins to prevent further ilnesses from apearing and that 's where the reduction of using cars must take place . Take the global warmig issue for example , it is already capturing peoples attention and driving people to wanting to do somthing about it .  The enviromental status will have larger impact on the human sociaty and would most propably change it 's economical structure . once that is done the idevidual wont be able to have the luxsiery of having his / her own car and there fore will force the reduction of using cars onto sociaty . Other methods of transportation would be even more popular than it is now . For example , public transportation , it would be a must and not an option . Not neglicting the fact the they are being used now very often . but is that for the right reasons ?  Perhaps If more people understood that fewer cars would do good for our planet we wont have to wait for twenty more years for people to stop using these harmful machines .	ARA
I agree with the opinion ; young people enjoy life more than older people do . Younger people have many relationship with other people from community such as school , company , or internet society . I believe that to keep being related with somebody makes life more enjoyable , because I can communicate and share the happiness or pleasure with others if I am related with somebody . Of course older people have the relationship with people , but it is much smaller than younder people has . Old people do not go to school , probably retired their job too , therefore younger people has larger relationship with others .  Younger people are more aggressive , active , and powerful . They can act and do as well as what they want to do . They can go other place whenever they want to go , they can play sports or other activities whatever they cant do . It is hard to move their body for older people .  I think many old people enjoys their hobbies inside their house or around their house by theirselves , but I do not think that those are real enjoyable things . My grandfather lives by himself since my drandmother was died , and he says he enjoy watering his bonsais and walking around his subdivision with his dog , but he does not look happy for real . If I do not have much relationship with people , it would not be so much fun at all . I think people can feel that `` I really enjoy doing this ! '' from their deeper part of their heart if they are connected with other people .  Therefore , I agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''	JPN
Young peple nowadyas do not give enough time helping their communites , because they are busy with other things although these other things can help society .  Students can help their society in many diffrent ways like when they study and graduate they will take a job to work for their society , also all the parties and celebtrating fistival for the nautre and for the annivrsary of the city they are living in in a usefull things to society .  On the other hand alot of young people really help their society in very obvoius way , many students like to visit kids or old people in the hospital and help them , this is a very wonderful job from the students .  As I 'm a student I can see that this statments is not true and u can make it general to all students there is some students who is lazy and do not help , although there is students who like to help and have a helpfull and friendly manner .

I completely agree with the idea that successful people are those who are more curious than other to do and learn new things . People that are still and do not feel the need of keep improving their abilities and are not ready to change and adapt to different situation and environments will hardly become important . For instance people that think that they can keep living in today 's world withough  Successful people in everyday 's life are those who are innovative , take risks and as soon as they have learnt something they are already oriented to another thing .  Capable managers in the field of industry consider research and development as a priority activity and a tremendous key factor in order to make a business successful . Let 's considere a very typical Italian example , a person that reached in his life a lot of success : Silvio Berlusconi . He started his carrer in the real estate , he was constructing and selling residential buildings , even though this market was successul he invested his first money buying a small television network . Year after year this business grew and he managed to buy other networks in Italy and in other countries as well . It was still not enough . With the money he gained from this business he bought a football team that was completely unknown , ac milan . He became president and in 15 years of presidency he made it one of the most popular team of the world . But he did not stop even at this point ! He started getting interested in politics and in 1994 he became the italian prime minister .  I think that this is one of the best example to understand how curiousity , capabilities , and inclination to try new things can make someone very successful .	ITA
I DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT BECOUSE , NO BODY SHOULD SUCCESS COUSING FAIL FOR SOME BODY ELS . IF EVERY BODY DO THE SAME THING , THEN , WHERE IS THE HUMINATATION . IF SOME BODY WANT TO DO SOME THING LIKE , MAKING A COMPANY HE SHOULD NOT DO IT BY HIM SELF FOR HIM SELF , NO , HE WILL NEED SOME BODY TO HELP HIM FOR ALL THIS THINGS	ARA
It is a common statement that today young people do not give enought time to hepling their communities . Although I think it is not always true , and each case should be considerated a part , I agree with this statement for several different reasons . Nowadays we are living in a world much more competitive than the past one was , furthermore , family is today normally composed only by parents and sons and this fact does n't help youg people to develope their sense of comunity .  Firts of all , the word where we are living in is getting more and more complex : for a young person is more diffucult today to achive his or her goals , to have a successful career ad a good job in order to give safety to his or her new family . This facts implies that today there 's generally not enought time to spend on taking care of someone else , like their communities .  The second problems is related to the normal structure of a family . Living in a such a small unit does't permit to develope , from chilhood , a sense of comunity and solidariety for other persons .  If someone is used to live in a family with many brothers and sisters , and also grandparents , uncles and aunts , he would be maybe more sensitive to the problems of the others .  In conclusion , I have to agree with the statement that sais that today yong people do n't spend much time on hepling their communities for the reasons that I explained before . I 've said `` I HAVE to agree '' because I think this is not a positive fact , and it gives a bad idea about young people , but , with sorry , I have to say that this is the truth .	ITA
Nowerdays every family seems to have at least one car . And we ca n't live in everywhere not to see cars running on streetsm , whereas we can use some alternative transportations such as trains , tubes and motorbikes . Many people have started working to work aor schools caring their hearlth . Using cars reguraly or using another way to transport , both of them have their advantages . It 's difficlut to guess in twenty years which will be more likely that there will be fewer cars or not . But if I had to predict our life in twenty years , I would n't say ther would be fewer cars than now . I disagree the idea the test had given me . There are some reason underneath .  Firstly , having cars is one of the popular havits amoung men . After working hard to earn enough money to buy cool car , they shows how cool cars they have bought driving through cities . It might be like thier dream to buy a good car .  Secondly , Toyota , which is known for the leading company in Japan have been making a big profit , and provide Japan a lot of profits . Now we can say it 's nessesary for our economy in Japan . In short we can see the fact that there will still be lots of demand in twenty years .  Thirdly , for family I 'll recomend to go trip by cars because it helps them feel being clother more than staying at home . on holiday even if they get stuck in traffic jam they can have a good conversation . Using cars is a good enjoyment .  In concludion , for those reason above , I disagree with the idea the question gave me . Of corse on the othe rhand we have to think about our environment more cafefully .	JPN
Some people think that nowadays young people do not help their communities as much as they should . I think this statement may be true for some people , but not for many other young people who actually make a great effort to help the communities where they live in .  It is true that modern society is becoming more and more individualistic , and this means that more and more people only care about themselves , disregarding the lives and potential problems of other people living in their community . This phenomenon is specially affecting young people , as they are growing in a society in which the most important values are realted with the personal achievements . The post a person occupies , the salary he or she recieves , the commodities of his or her house , the car , the clothes , and other material things that a person may own are nowadays far more important than the ethics of a person and his or her behaviour towards other human beings and the place he or she inhabits .  However , it is not fair to afirm that all young people act in that way . There are many young people that really help their communities in many different ways . Some of them apply for taking part as volunteers in programs designed to help people with different kind of problems that range from disabled people , inmigrants , children who suffer from cancer , old people who live alone , and so on . Some of them even travel to remote areas in Asia , Africa and South America to enrole in international aid organizations that deal with very serious problems affecting millions of people in those continents , such as natural disasters , wars and epidemies among others .  Summing up , because ot today 's society , there are some young people who are forgetting to take care about the others and their communities , but there are many other young people who dedicate an important part of their lives to help people that are in a difficult situation . In my opinion , everybody should follow their example .	SPA
Although many people tend to avoid trying new things and take risks , I oppose to that attitude because to me it seems to be boring doing always the same . On the one hand , if you take risks , there is always the danger to fail . Depending on how great the risk is , you may loose nearly everything you possess . Admittedly , this is a even harder decision , if you are responsible for a family . I remember a time in my childhood , when my father thought of expanding his local drug store . Certainly it had been a great chance but after severel sleepless nights he decided not to take the risk due to his care about his family . In addition , trying something new always comes together with a lot of hard work . Why should you do it , if you can hold your status with a work you know to do well ?  In my opininion , you do it , because you will get rewarded , if you try something new . I find , trying out new things is fun and interesting . In other words , when I try something new , I have the wonderful chance to broaden my horizons . If you never give it a try , you will never experience if there is something you would like better . I , for example , invested all my money during my studies to open a small copy shop for co-eds . What I received back from this little business was not only the money to finance my studies , but also the unvaluable experience of applying my theoretical knowledge from university to the real business world . This helped me a lot to succeed .  In a nutshell , I agree that it is more comfortable to do only the things you know well . However , risking something improves our experience and provokes innovation , the latter being one of the key factors that thrive our economy .	GER
I agree with the fact , that if you want to be successful , you have to take risks sometimes . I want to stress that it does depend on the individual 's situation .  For example , if a creative director of an advertising agency has had lots of success with using one certain method in creating an ad , it is smart to stick with that method . At some point , as time changes , people 's interests change and the creative director needs to consider a differnt method in creating an ad . If the director wo n't consider doing so , he might lose his clients . This is when I would say that it is important to take a risk and do something different with your ad .  Based on my own experiences I have to say that I had more success with taking risks at times . For example , I have great passion for the arts and therefore , I have taken quite a few drawing and painting classes in the past . At some point , one of my teachers graded me down on one of my projects , because apparently I always used the same method in drawing , and I never tried something new .  This is when I decided to try pastell paint , instead of the good old charcoal . My teacher was impressed by the color composition , which was a change from just black and white drawings . My teacher gave me a better grade , not necessarily because the picture was better than my other pictures , but rather because of the fact that I was able to deal with something new , such as pastell .  Trying new things gives you exposure to different perspectives , which makes you a more open person to new things . If you constantly stick with the same old thing , you show a lack of flexibility . It also shows that you can only be successful in the same area .  If you try and practice different things , it gives you the opportunity to show more expertise in different areas . If you do n't take the risk of trying something new , you never know whether you could be more successful or not .	GER
I totally disagree with this statement because is a general rule that from the facts the ideas or concepts is getting .  In fact , for students are more important to know the facts then they can analyze them and prove it , so they can build their own ideas or make their concepts about .  For me is like the practice and the theory . The fact in some measure is how the situation has been developed , the facts helps to students to understand more efficient and quickly because the facts can explain them datails about the situation and they can obtain a better idea about what they are studying .  There are many ideas and concept about topics depend on the way the person understand the facts . To explain this opinion , I 'm going to give you an example : The fact that one children have to study is a general idea , but there are many concepts around this fact , but the fact always has to know it , as a result of it many ideas and concepts begin to be developed for example , some people can say that they does n't agree with this fact , but many persons agree with the fact that is so important for children to study and they should do it , only in this fact we have two diferents ideas , and if we continued analyzing the fact we are going to obtain many reason to be agree or disagree with it , but the fact does n't change , it is like the root of the situation or topic .  In conclution I think that it is more important for students to understand the facts and then they can understand the ideas of the other person and make their own ideas about the situation and prove	SPA
I definitely think that is very good and essential for an individual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . By knowing about many subjects one is more comfartable in interacting with all kinds of people because it will not be difficult to have a healthy conversation as we will not be totally unaware of what the other person is talking to us about .  Another important reason why we should have knowledge about different subjects is that we never know what bad phase in life we might go through . To be able to stay put in all situations and to be able to work our way through all difficult times we should have at least the bare minimal knowledge required in every field . This broadens our horizon to work and not be stranded in various situations in life .  If we have only specific knowledge about one field it is not always necessary that we may have enough luck in our fate to make it big in that field . To keep that door of opportunity open for us at all times we should have knowledge about a variety of things in life . Lets take the example of a simple clerk who has been used to entering data into a register manually all his life . With the development of science and technology there will come a time in his professional life where his company might install computers to manage the data . The clerk would now be required to work on this new marvelous invention . If the clerk had always been satisfied throughout his life with his manual labour and would not have updated himself in this new technology he would have been blank as the the knowledge of computers and this would in turn lead to him losing his job where someone who is computer savvy might get the job ; but having been update with happening in different fields the clerk would find it simple to navigate throught the system in turn making his work easier for himself .  This was a very small but ver effective example as to why we should be in touch with things that are goin on around us . As they say ` little knowledge maybe dangerous ' . Keeping this in mind i firmly believe and state that it would be in our best interest if we knew more things about other fields as well rather than just knowning everything about one .	HIN
Traveling in a group and being led by a tour guide has both advantages and disadvantages and the consideration about whether it is a best way of traveling or not depends on many factors .  Suppose you are a busy working man and you want to spend your vacation or annual leave . You have a week or two and you plan to go somewhere . First of all , most people wants comfort in such cases and they would want go to the major sightseeings . In such cases , organized tour led by a guide is the best option : the tourist company will arrange everything for you - all you have to do is enjoy . The guide will tell you what most travelers would like to know and you do n't have refer to a book to find out about the sightseeing you 're at . You are free of all the uncertainties and risks involved in traveling alone and being responsible for yourself .  But traveling in a group led by a tour guide has several restrictions and they are even frustrating if you are seeking adventures or totally personal experiences . I felt it personally when I went to a turkic tombstone in rural Mongolia with a group of tourists . The tombstone was awsome at least for me for I was interested in Turkic history . It had inscription on it and I was badly wanting to try to read it on my own ( I once spent some time trying to learn the old letters ) . But the group had only 2 hours to spend there and I had to leave the tombstone with them too because other members of the group did not share the same interest and the schedule said that we should be at the tourist camp by 4 o'clock . I felt so frustrated that I decided then that I will go there alone sometime afterwards . So this example of mine illustrates the bad point of guided travel - you 're not free to decide where to go or where to stay for how long . You ca n't actually , if I can put it this way , `` taste '' the activity and the place because the experience is not all yours : it rather turns out to be a group experience and it does not give you that feeling when you find do something , think about something out , experience something on your own without being distracted .  Personally , therefore , I prefer to travel alone if I have enough time but at the same time , I agree that organized travel can be useful and enjoyable experience if you does not have enough time or if you are not really into the destination of your travel .

The statement says that students should importantly understand ideas and concepts instead of learning them . This is a question that I face myself as a student almost every day . On the one hand it is necessary to understand the theory that lies beneth all facts and all new information , in a way to get a solit knowledge how things work . On the other hand it is also necessary to just learn new words or relationships . Without that base knowledge it is not possible to communicate with others because they do not know what you are talking about .  I guess there is no black and white view whether to say that a student should learn everything new just by heart or to understand just the facts . It must be a middleway you have to find to combine this both views .  When repitition is the aim then i would say that learning the facts is enough but when it is necessary to find new conclusions and relations between different cases then it is a must to understand basicaly what the new information wants to tell .  Nowadays the knowledge is given to everybody through various databases like books or the ultimate information base with techonolgy of the internet . It is just a matter of how to find information and how long you need to access the new information . It is getting more and more unimportent to know every fact by heart with help from data on pages like wikipedia online . With that help it is just a matter of a few seconds to access the right topic and to get any information that is so enormous nobody could keep in mind .  To come to a conclusion I wish that in many more fields then today already exist students learn the `` why '' standing behind instead of just pure facts and knowledge they will never need in that particulaly case in the future .

One of the main problem of the scholastic system in Italy is the huge program we have for all the subjects we have to learn . I can say for my own experience that the most of the informations they gives us at school is forgiven immediately after we study them . I completely agree with the statement , It is more important for students to understand ideas . A famous italian writer once sayd that what we call culture is not what we REMEMBER to have studied at school , but the mix of all the experiences and of all the ideas we have and it does n't matter if we do n't remember some stupid details about something we studied years and years ago .  In my opinion a good teacher should try to guide a student throught history ( for example ) not filling his head with dates or names of ancient emperors and facts , but just trying to passionate that student talking about the differences between our life and life of that time , trying to bring the student in a fantastic world with the wand of fantasy . Of course we can say the same for the most of the subjects , but with some exception like for mathematic or phisic . Moreover , we can forget learned facts , even because they could not match with our everyday life so that we could never have the opportunity to recall that fact to our mind but we can be sure that if we have learned the idea of something we 'll never let it out .  It is more important for students to have the taste of things and this allows to have passions and interests . In conclusion Italian school ( but I 'm pretty convinced it is a problem felt in other countryes ) should give values to its students , just the sense of how many things we do n't know and open the door to infinite worlds students should explore by theyrselves depending on theyr interests .

The idea of whether broading knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize and focus in one specific subject has been a matter of debat recently in many countries . In my point of view , I believe that broading different many knowledge will give studnt the ability and the basic background to understand the real life to be able to disscuss different subjects , argue in many issues , and to improve himself . Also , be awaring of many academic subjects will give the studnt the ability to go through different fields and chose the best major he wants to drill in .  I believe that spread more than one subject in the academic year especially in the first and second years will allow the student to be aware of what is going around his world . Studnt who is going to study about education , social studies , Politics , Arts , and may be Math will be able to understand his country and his socity peroblems and will have more ideas than a student who never heared about politics or arts and only study for his math major .  Moreover , students in their first year will never be able to take the right decision for their career life and chossing the major they want to enroll-in as they dont have the enough knowledeg and experiance to chose among all these alternatives . For example , in my first year and directly after the high school I had to chose my career and my whole future based on my zero experiance and approximatley zero knowledge , of course if in my country i was able to gain and aquire the basics of more than a knowledge absolutly i was going to chose something else or if i didnt chose something else ; at least i would know that my choice was the right chice for me .  To conclude , I STRONGLY recommend and agree with having broad knowaledge of many academic subjects before focusing in the specific field of knowledge which I believe it will be the best for my future career and which will be helpful for my socity .

I agree that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just emphasis on one specific subject . Students who know more different categories of knowledge , they are usually more open-mind , easier to make friends , and have higher successful rate after guadrated .  In this modern business world , all business can be connected with other categories ' business . Assuming a student is graduated , and looking a job in a company . Obviously , if the student says he or she has a BA degree on business , AAS degree on Financial , and some club leaders ; it is ofter get hired easier than only a Dr. financial degree . This is possible because the higher degree the student has , the student would requires higher wages and more power in the company , but the student can only help the company 's financial department . However , the other student has some background knowledge of business and financial , so this student could be able to help the company in two departments , which this student comes more valuable and useful .  Moreover , the student who have broad knowledge of different subjects has more oppoturnity to get a better job , and be able to make more money . The multi-knowledge helps people easier to make friends especially if you have some common interests with people . It is a key to make different types of friends around the world . And these friends might be the one who would give you good life in the future , which means that more the knowledge you have , the more life you get	CHI
sometimes our parents tell us that , the time has cahanged very much . the youth also has changed according to time . young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities since they have no connection with them . there are some reasons for they have no connection .  young people have some new interests and habbits . they are addictive to entertainment devices , such as tv and computer . they wach what happens in the world in tv and connect all the conutrys people by internet . this make them not communicate with their communiyies .  on the other hand , parents dont give enough information about their customs , what manner to speak or bahave to their communties . this makes young people to be less familiar with their customs so they find other things to be familiar with .  furthermore nowadays the young people have to study harder than they had to before . the university exams and high school enterance exams make them consantrate on their lessons and dont let them interest any other things . so young people cant communicate with their communities .  the young people are supposed to be helping the community . they dont do that since they have no time to be in contact with the community . they have other interests , lots of lessons to study and have no education about their customs .

In our studies , we often have the choice between learning many academic subjects and specialize in one in particular . It can be quite a dillema . In my opinion , specializing , at least in the end of our studies , is more interresting . I will explain the advantage and disadvantage of each solution and explicit my feelings .  Broad knowledge of academic subjects is appealing at first . You do n't have to make the choice between the themes you like , and learning from one can improve our understanding of another . For instance , learning the living of species in biology class can help in ecology class . Swithing between subjects often also help on not getting bored . On the contrary you do n't have enough time to each class , and that can be really frustrating to learn only basics in the one you enjoy the most .  The other choice that is offered to us is specializing . The great thing about it is learning more and more information about a subject you like ( or at least you should like ) and getting more and more confident about it . Furtheremore you make less mistakes . The major drawback is when you need knowledge ( even basic ) on other academic subjects you do n't have them , and probably do n't have the time to learn them , and need to ask for help . This will result in a huge loss of time . An other negative aspect about specializing is that sometimes you are to much concentrate on your subject you ca n't see by yourself the mistake you are doing .  Finally , i prefer to specialize in a topic than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . The main reason is that you can be good in a topic only if you practice often , and i do n't mind asking for help if i need knowledge about another subject in order to fullfil my work . Moreover , in order to begin in profesional life you need to be good at least one thing .	FRE
In my view , while one may say that people in general do not give enought time to help their communities , I do not think that young people do not help enought .  The first reason for my view is simply that I know many young people who care a lot . Some of them would help directly their communities , by spending time with olders , or taking care of adults ' children . Some others would even make bigger things to help people in the world . For example , I have a friend who left France last year , to work as a benevol to build a school in a certain country in Africa .  The second reason for my view is that we had never seen young people caring and participating this much before . In the last presidential election in France in 2002 , when Jean-Marie Le Pen , who is known to have racists and seggregated opinions , reached the second phase of the election , the first group who demonstrated in the street to show its reluctance of seeing such a man becoming the president was a group of students and some teenagers from highschool . I believe this would have never happened before .  Finally , I think it is important to say that young people do not have always the possibility to show that they care . Indeed , young people do not win much money , if any at all . They are at an age where they have to give priority to theirs studies , or have just started a job which can be a very difficult period . Because of all this reasons , I think that even if some people think it is too low , the young people are helping communities largely enought .  To sum up , I believe that while it is sometimes difficult for young people to find the time and the money to help communities , they are caring enought , specially compared with the past . According to me , young people more and more understand that they are crucial actors of the community .	FRE
in my university experience i always appreciated what i learnt when i was at the high school . during my high school time in italy i used to study latin and ancient greek . our professor was always explaining us how to study these two classical languages was giving us the capacity to use in a really better way our mind , learning something that was improving our way `` to think '' .  ancient greek and overall latin can help you to understand better a specific topic because they are based on a logic structure . latin is really similar to math and it can permit you to elaborate more sophisticated concept when you know how to use words or sentences in a logic way . my high school was called `` classic high school '' in opposition with scentific high school . i didnt learn specific and practic arguments as math , phisic or geometry but i learnt to think . during my university time , at the architectural school in Milan , i found out how much was true my professor 's statement because i didnt get any problems to study really difficult arguments as math , structure , calculation , etc. because my mind was able to process every kind of data , even if they were different from what i studied at the high school .  for this reason i think it 's really important for every student , with every kind of personal background and goal , to understand and to learn how to understand ideas and concepts instead of just merely learning facts .  when you are able to understand an ideas or a concepts you can approach these things with a critic view , elaborate them and creating a personal view about them , and not just learning facts without understanding why they happend , wich reason generated them .  for students ' future is the most important thing and understanding ideas and concepts will give them specific skills to approach every kind of problems in life .

I agree with the statment that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . People become successful when they achive a goal which is considered to be appreciable by not only their peers but also the society as a whole .  Consider the stock market for example , one of the leading men in investment banking is Warren Buffet who made his fortune by investing in ideas that others were scared to support . Eventually he became one of the richest men in the world . '' Taken the beaten path wo n't take you anywhere '' is what he said .  I have seen my father benifiting from investing in a contra fund , i.e. a mutual fund that invests on stocks which contradict the market dynamics and trends . So it does pay to go into uncharted teritories .  Some of the most important discoveries of modern times has been electricity and the antibiotic ( like pencilline ) which would n't have taken place if people like Faraday and Fleming did n't dare to put their life on the line . Thus I would say that the people who dare , do reep the friuts of their success better .  Famous explorers became successful because they believed in their instinct and sailed on for days in search of new and promising lands . The most important discovery has been that of the Americas by the european explorers . And look where America is today , arguably the most powerfull nation in the world .  When you are a one in a million you are not recognized , you have to stand out from the crowds and make your own space , create your own niche . And there are many stoires of success where an indivudal attained success when he goes out and takes some chances . So I do think that the a persons willingness to take risks along with a dash of hardwork and dediction will eventually make him successful	TEL
To answer this question it is important to figure out the reasons why young people support their community . Mostly the younger people join groups to have people around to enjoy the time with friends . This can happen in the church community , sport clubs or just for hanging loose . Especially activities in church try to teach the younger ones how important it is to e.g. help people with disabillities . But because of the increase of the media consumption , especially TV , community activities are being told to be `` uncool '' . It is more important to be individual and gain your own popularity . Another reason can be that people loose trust in their government . They feel the pressure which lasts on them if they want to have success in their life . So they try to get the best for their own advance . As well when the people recognise that government members who should serve the public think it is more important to fill their own pockets . This can have the effect that people turn to be more egoistic . Especially because of the new information era the people are aware of the selfishness of some government members . As well they are told about the risks in life every day in the news . I think this constant pressure and the lack of honesty has lead to the point that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . But with the society being aware of that matter , chances ar not bad that a new way of thinking and acting can be taught . So you can see a lot of effort being taken from media and government to emphasize this problem and to point out how important it is to serve the community . Hopefullly this will lead modern societies to a turning point where serving is something good an has not to be `` uncool '' .	GER
I would like to travel in a group led by tour guide , because this way makes my trip better .  Actually , there are negative aspects in a group trip . For examle , it reduces my own free time . If I travel in a group , I have to pay attension to other people so even when I want to buy suvenior taking a long time , I can not do this .  However there are more good aspects in a group trip . Last year , I went to Australia in a group . As it was my first trip to go abroad , I felt a little nurvous at the first time but gradually we began to talk each other and my nurvousness was removed . More , during the trip , I lost my wallet , but people who travel with me looked for my wallet together . At that time , I was very moved . Moreover , a tour guide taught me a lot of things about Australia . Before I traveled in Australia , I know few things about Australia , but thanks to a toue guide , I learn a lot of things about Australia , for instance , the history of Australia and aboliginy . When I was a junior high school student , I read a book whose main locaion is Australlia and the man in the book climbs the ululu , so I wanted to climb there . However a tour guide told me that ululu is the speciall place for aboliginy and they do not want us to climb . I did not know such a thing .  That is why , thanks to a trip in a group and tour guid , I had a very good time during my trip , so I agree with the statement that the best way to travel in a group led by tour guide .	JPN
The big industries are famous , because generally their products are better than other products of small industries . I think that , the trayectory and the knowledge of the company permits to identify if any product is better than other . For example , I went to supermarket and I buy a unknow oil , because this was more cheap and I did not show big differences between my normal oil and this , but when I used this product I show that I loose my money , becuse this product had a less quality of my habitual oil .  Therefore , I think to that there are famous companys , but this is not a garanteer for a good product . For example , currently a famous company of toys had problems with its toys , because the toys have a dangerous chemical ; this toys industry is famous around in the world , but this is not complete garanteer for tha quality of the products .  I agree with this idea : `` Most advertisements me \ ake products seem much better than really are '' because the market is a war for the consummers . So , the quality of the products is determines for the people , I think that , the especialization in the production of the products helps to people know that product is better that other , because if the company only make a special product , the products will be more techniques and with less price than before .  There are products better than others jus in appareance , but people should say which product is better when they obtain it , because it is better for their options in the market and in the habitual consummer , they have a social function too .

The issue of whether nowadays people do not give enough time to helping their communities is a controversial one . On the one hand , there are some people that spent most of their time thinking how they can help their community . On the other hand , there are some people that really do n't care in helping their society . They just think on their own problems and do n't have enough time for other people . However , in the final analysis I therefore agree with the statement that people do not gave enough time to help their society .  One reason for my belief is that in current business world people do n't have time to help their communities . Current business world demand a lot of time and at the end of the day people are very tired .  For example , five years ago I worked for an advertising company . Advertising is a very difficult work and in that time of my life I usually spent more than 12 hours in my office . When I returned home at 9 o'clock I was really tired . It was impossible for me to help my community . The only thing I wanted to do was to go and rest . It was impossible for me to try to help society , I was always tired when I was n't at work .  Another reason for my belief is that people had become more selfish . People just focus on what it is important for them . They do not care about what happens to other people , they just think on their own problems . Recent research shows than less than 15 % of the people from my hometown had helped the community in the last two years .  For the reasons stated above I agree with the statement that nowadays people do not gave enough time to helping their communities . I support my point of view by two main points . First , that current business world demands a lot of people time and second that people had become more selfish .	SPA
In todays world , nearly every product which is offered to consumers , is being marketed with advertisements . These advertisements introduce the product to its buyers and demands them to buy it . Although these advertising is good in terms of marketing and introducing new products , it is also clear that these advertisements could result in wrong , over-rated assumptions about the product in question because of three major reasons ; the the fact that the advertisement is a marketing technique , the varying expectations of the people and the influence of professional techniques to our emotions .  Firstly , the definition of today 's advertising is `` making people want something '' , the introducing part of the advertising is being ignored . For instance ; advertisements are being prepared by marketing departments to sell them more and more to make profits , not just to declare that the product is made . The increasing number of adverisement-officies and the money in this job also indicates that everything about advertisement is about making more money . Because of these factors happiness of the consumer is usually being ignored . Secondly , people often expect differrent things from a product , one may want durability but the other may want more reasonable price , but an advertisement should be prepared for every potential buyers . Plus , a negative feature which people may want to know would not be emphesized because of these thinking . This , again , would result in the disappointment of the buyer . The third thing that would make buyers uncomfortable is the fact that advertising is being used for a long time and there have been clear ways to make you buy thing . For example , when I saw a person who drinks or eats something I immediately feel a bit thirsty or hungry because my mind thinks of an oppurtunity to eat something . This fact will affect me to buy the stuff which is being advertised , but probably I would be disappointed becasue I would have bought the think without thinking .  Advertising has becoming a great part of producing and marketing of new goods , every company is using it for nearly every good it produces . It is clear that this thing makes people to buy thing , otherwise profit centered companies would n't use them , but making people buy something directly increases the expectations and therefore , as people expect more from the thing whic they buy , they become more disappointed .

I believe that is treue that the young people do not give enough time to helping their comunities but this is caused for the society and the parents .  I am a young girl and I am totally agree with this statement . In my opinion the youngers are busy in their own things and don-t worry of the troubles that appear in their own comunity . They and I think that there are people that worry of the things of the society yet and they will look for some solution .  The youngers that have a good life are the less worried because their parents help them and will solve their problems and they don-t think that when they will be adults won-t stay their parents .  I know that this position is worse but this is that our parents teach our . Some exemples are when we throw some paper at floor and we aren-t be able to take the paper and put in the rubbish . Or when somebody paint with a spray on the doors . .. This persons don-t think when they do that , they do that they like .  I wish that the youngers were more careful and that they think before to do anything . They have to know that whole the worse of the society is bad for they . I like that the politics would do more programes for the young people because this would help to envelope on the troubles of the society .  And believe that with the help of the whole our own comunity will became to be better !	SPA
Nowadays , there is a hot topic about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do . Some people think that old people have more time to enjoy the life . Others may disagree and contend that young people are more energetic and more likely to enjoy the life . If I were faced this issue , I will definitely support the latter point . there are numerous reasons to support this point and I would only explore some of them and describe as follows : The first and foremost reson to support my point is just as someone said , young people are more energetic than older people . This is essily seen in the entertainment fields . For example , young people are more concering on the entertainment events like movie , music , entertaining stars . They will spend lots of their leisure time talking and watching them . Their physical conditions also allow them to do so for a long time . You seldom see the old people in a disco bar . In a word , since young people have more power , they are more likely to enjoy the life .  The sencond and significant reason for my view is that young people are more creative than older people . It is obvious in teenagers . A scientific research show that since young people 's brain in the formative period , they conuld accept new things easily . For instance , the Internet is widely used in the recent decades . The user of them are mostly young people . No wonder someone represent young people as the rising sun at about eight or nine o'clock . their creativity enable them to enjoy the life most .  In conclusion , it is not hard to find that young people can enjoy life most than any other age people because of their energy and creativity . But we also encourage the older people learn from the young and never give up the life .	CHI
I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . For example , one of my classmates , Anna Bron is very successful in my Advanced Placement in Art 12 class by trying new things .  Anna Bron is a well known to be a good painter in my school . She said she felt most comfortable with painting and she liked to challenge herself by doing hard things . She has been successful by challenge herself . However , what brought her to the most successful stage was challenge herself by doing easy things .  There is a project called `` Concentration '' that all of AP Art12 students have to do . Anna choose to use teabags to symbolize memory of our lives . She believed that used teabags have a memory to each people depends on why that person drank that tea , when they drank it , where they drank it . Her first idea was to make a canvas out of those teabags and paint on it . As I mentioned before , she feels most comfortable with paiting .  Her subject matter was very interesting , but her idea of paint on it bothered my art teacher . My teacher suggested her not to paint on it but find a way to make it interesting by using teabag itself . Anna said , `` but . . that is going to be too easy . '' She thought making some art project in easy way will result low quality work . No drawing or paining was a big challge for Anna . However , she decided to take my teacher 's advise .  Anna tried new things by make it simple and by using teabag itself . Once she told me that it is so hard to do something so simple and she is not used to it . Later , she found her way to make those teabags seem interesting . She laid out those teabags and made a mobile ; quilted with different kinds of teagbags ; and other different experimentation . Anna is now making dress out of her teabags that she collected from people and she is acheiving very high stage as an artist . She is not only recieving a high mark in AP Art 12 class but also having the opportunity to try new things . She is successful by experimenting new things .	KOR
I strongly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time for helping their communities . On of the reason is that they do not have time to spend time on those things . They must spend most of their time on studying in order to get good grade and go to well-known university .  Also young people nowadays are not good at comunicating with others and are hestate to meet new people . It occures as people no longer talk with neibour as much as we did before . There is one example in my community . There was an opportunity visiting a house , which were for eldery people to live , in the communities . It was an opportunity only for children but there were only two people attended . The reason why rest did n't come was that they were afraid to meet and talk with new people .  The other reason is that young people nowadays are not intrested in helping communities . School does not teach how important it is to help the communities and join the activities , they only teach things that the students need for exam . Adult should encourage young people to give more time on helping communities .	JPN
In my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because facts make students bored while the ideas and concepts seemed as interesting . First , from the beginning of my education in my school teachers always gave me some facts and everytime I asked myself what would I do with them . I think learning facts would not improve students because we can not change these facts we can not deny them or we can not develop them . The reason for this is that they are all about the past . They have already proved and the last thing we can do is admitting them and living according to these facts . On the other hand , bringing some ideas and understanding concepts is very important since you are thinking and creating your own values .  Second , when making a career , it is necessary to define what is happenning around the world . You can not defend yourself according the facts but ideas or concepts . You should make logical comments about global events not only about their obvious features but also what is hidden so that you should understand ideas and concepts to make sensible sentences .  Finally , I agree that it is important to understand ideas and concepts to be creative and sensible .	TUR
Being led by a tour guide while travelling in a group is one of the best ways to do , where this seems to make it more special and interesting .  A person would get to know more people from the group , which will make the trip feel enjoyable . A tour guide will help in discovering alot of new stuff , and will show the tourists so many amazing places , especially if this is their first visit to the country . People usually travelling alone to another countries and trying to explore the best places by themselves , are going to face much difficulties doing that since they do n't have any idea of what they are looking for , and whether they will like or not . Unlike the tour guide , who will save the tourists plenty of time introducing them to all the hot areas , one after the other because he knows almost every location in the country . Moreover , people sometimes pass by alot of old buildings without even noticing their significance and their history too . While , a tour guide will provide the toursists with all the details and the history of related to these places . Tourists are going to enjoy it more , and they will feel better after being told what to do and how to react to a certain situation opposing them .  A tour guide will help the tourists spend the best time , so they would know what to do and where to go , incase they visit again sometime later .	ARA
All the people pass in different ages of their life , we can find kids , youngs , adults and older and in each part of life people can enjoy their life , but in each part differ from the other by the enjoy of life , where some people says that young people enjoy life more than older people do so it 's true to say that .  For the young people we can see that they enjoy life more than older because they still young new to explore life , so they have new things to see and learn in life and to enjoy it they are free to go everywhere they will have many new opportunities to choose their life to make friends to go out partying to participate in real life where they can join services groups or political groups for example they will share the political life they will have their opinion . And they will decide what they want to be in their futur life for example an engineer so they will join the university after they will dream about their futur life , and they will really enjoy life when they will love a person they will dreams about making a family . So they will have many things to enjoy and to share it with others .  In the same time the older people enjoy life in many ways , when they will remember their own life that passed and the things what they did they will see their family growing up and especially they will be happy when they will carry their children 's childrens they will be absolutley enjoying life and the older people will enjoy their life after the retirement they will be free for example to go fishing hunting whatever , in the same time they will have problems but they will still enjoying life with the rest .  Finally , all the young or old people will enjoy their life in differents ways , but we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have many differents ways to enjoy it than older people have .

Generalization versur Specializations .  Some people prefer specific academic subjects than many academic subjects . I agree with thhis prefences for several reason . The fist reason is you can be an expert in the matter . The second reason is you can get proffesional develop and get a good job , and the third reason is solve specific problems .  The first reason that refers to be a expert in the matter explain the idea to be some person to have the knowledge to get the information and this person can explain and show results . For instance , the people that studie Bachelor degree in Economics , Master degree in Macroeconomics and Phd in Microeconomics coul be get the profile of kind of person to develop some theory about the behavior in the consume and demand respect the National Economy .  The second reason refers to the posibility to get profesional develop and access to a betters a jobs . For example , if you have a Phd in Computer Science you can be a candidate for the bigs companies like Microsoft to contract to you .  The Third reason refers to the idea to solve specific problems . For instance , if you are studying some related with medice maybe you can find the solution to big problems like VIH or Cancer or Diabetis .  In conclusion , I agree with the idea to be specialist in some area is better than get just general knowledges and to be an specialist is equal to say an expert in the matter and maybe be an expert in the matter brings to you in the future profesional develop and oportinities to access betters jobs .

First of all , I agree with the statement given here that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a fow guide ''  My first reason is , as we go to a new palce , we may not be knowing how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the people , what their culture is , what their custumes are , whta their tradition is etc . If we go to some american countires , we may find some difficulty , understanding their language and aslo we can not understand their accent eventhough their speak english . For example suppose you planned to go France . The language the people speak there is French . You may not understand French . Here you need a guide .  My second reason is , if the palce you planned to tour a historic place without a guide , you finally end up with the rockey structures you saw there . As each historic place has a history behind in the main purpose of visi is to know its history . As we are not familiar with the palce and its history , a guide it is right person to expalin it . Fot example , take an instance os vising mahabalipuram , a famous historic site in India . It 's all filled with temples made ofrock , carring on stone etc . We need a guide to expalin what rocky strutures are .  And lastly the important thing is fullfilling the purpose for which have spent the money , lets suppose you have palnned an Europe tour . But you did not have a proper person with you to expalin their what is the purpose of visiting is not knowing any thing .	TEL
I disagree with the argument that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . Actually , it might be helpful to have many knowledge but objectively , that is unnccessary than to specialize in one specific subject . anybody have many other knowledges by useing some times . but if to specialize in one specific subject . than you will get more specific knowledge that other people do not know about it . it is more useful to have the knowledge . for example , let say you are the owner of the company and you want to hire some one for marketing section and there are two people who went just a university and aother went a specific business college . who do you going to hire for your business ? I am not saying that the just university person is bad but , objectively , I will hire the specific business college . because I want the person who have a idea of a specific section , which is business and who have lots of knowledge at the field . and not only my question but also the real world is like that . There are lots of people who are achieve at their field such as CEO of Microsoft , not only he was good at but also he was ti soecializ in one specific subject . may be to have broad knowledgeof many academic subjects will helps you to decide your field but if you have your goal alraedy than i suggest that to have knowledge in one thing . and eventhought you think it is waste fo time but do not stop . because no body will going to have that your effort and you will get the golden age for your appreciate .

I disagree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today even besides in all over the world now , we are considering about the enviroment , and oil is decreasing now .  I know that there were some agreements about the gas producing by cars . Cars are very bad for enviroment because they run with gas which pollutes earth 's air . Many countries promise that they are going to reduce gas which is from cars in present days . My country , Japan also did and now we are trying to do this plan . However , I never see this successful and people who are using cars do not care about it at all .  I also hear that oil is not going to take anymore . Now , most of cars in this world run with oil . Actually there are electrinic cars , but it is unuseful to use because it takes time to make cars run so we still use a car running with oil . I think that there still will be some oil in twenty years .  Cars are absolutly usefull . We can go to anywhere in anytime by cars . People living in metolopolis might not need cars , but people living in rural area have to use car to live in . They live in far away from grocely stores , malls , and places they work at . Needless to say , we need indivisual cars . We can not use public system such as buses , trains because it may be faster to transport than we use public transportation . In addition , most of us will keep using indivisual cars .  I think that there are not things which we can reduce car using because we do not care enviroment , we care only ourselves , electronic car are not useful , I do not think electronic car is becoming useful , and actually people really need car .	JPN
There are discussion that in the future , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Although some people thinks that using the car increase than nowadays . Because they think that the car is the most thing to not improve and they do n't have side-effects . But I think that there will be decrease in using the car in the future . There are several reasons .  First , Nowadays , there is problem that oil , gas is reduce because of unplanned excavation . So it cause to lack of oil to move . It means that although we have a lot of cars , we can not drive because there is no oil to move . Therefore we need to other substitute oil or alternating method for movements . I think that find alternating methods for movements outweigh to find other oil .  Second , The car cause pollution of air . Actually the car produce CO2 , NOx . It increase earth 's temperature . So , the height of sea is increase . Maybe our lands will be under the water . Imagine that condition you do n't have land to plant and to live in . From these problem , many human is studying to find other method to move that it is not cause to pollute the air .  Third , the car is unconvenient . Because it can not only out of order frequently but also ca n't cross the other continent . Nowadays , there is global world . So to increase the power of nation , we should invent free-cross continents like ship and planes to trade easily .  For these above mentioned reasons , there is no doubt in my mind that there will be fewer cars in use , in the future . Because it cause air pollution and gradually the oil is reduced .	KOR
I does n't agree with the statement ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' !  I think one reason is that there are some big differences between young people and older people because older people have other experiences than the younger people ! You can not put them on the same basic . In my opionen older people enjoy their life in an other way then in their past . In the past parents were much stronger with their chlidren than today . Older people enjoy their life with doing other activities than the younger people do . They have n't go to a club or a disco to enjoy their freetime . They do things like travelling and walking around or reading interesting books or something else .  When you are older you also have more possibilities to enjoy your life because you may be have more money than the younger people .  For me it is really terrible that young people enjoy life often in a very strange way . Often they have to drink alcohol or putting drugs into their body to have fun ! For me it is not a way of enjoying life .  For example there are my parents . In their younger life they did n't enjoy life like they do it today . That is because they became mum and dad in their younger days and so they were n't able to have fun like teenagers or young people in nowadays . But today their childern are adults and do n't live at home , so they are able to make holidays or go to cinema or something like that whenever they want to . I think that is a good way of enjoying life and freetime .  To give a short conclusion it is important to enjoy life when you are young and when you are old .	GER
I completely agree with the topic that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than they are today . Today the technology is more advanced than yesteryears and there can be more advancement in the near future . With the advancement of technology cars may be replaced by some newer inventions .  Firstly , if we consider the time before fifty or sixty years back , there were more number of bicycles . And after that , with the invention of bikes people mostly travelled on them . Further with the invention of cars the number of bikes and their usage has decreased .  After twenty years there may be any other advanced invention which may replace the cars . For instance if a flying machine is invented for benefit of a common man then there will be more flying machines and less number of cars .  Secondly it can be said that the needs of the people keep changing with time . After twenty years if some thing more cheaper or more advanced than cars is made available then there can be fewer cars than they are today . With the increase in needs of people any other advanced invention can replace cars . And the number of cars can decrease .  Lastly i conclude that in the next twenty years there will be less number of cars than they are today .	TEL
In our life , all of us want to live in good , confortable conditions , want to have a big house and also a nice car and money till death . But for this suitable life can not be won easily . It wants successful . And for the success ; open mind , risk and new trials are necessary .  There are two kinds of people . One of what is successful and the other is unsuccessful in the life .  In my opinion , successfull people are open minded and always ready to try something new and try to develop a process or a project or a subject . In addition to these they like to take risks for the success . But on the other hand , some people stay away from risk , new projects and also they are afraid of trials . They live according to their life rules .  If we focus on the professors-scholars working , educating and researching in the universities , colleges and also in institudes , we could determine the success on their faces by investigating their reliable behaviours , talkings , smilings . .. etc we know that they dont get afraid of making mistakes becouse they believe that if they m make mistake it will turn to them as success  On the other hand if the other people afraid of making mistakes , taking risk and stay dependent on their own rules , could not be successful . For example , if an unsuccessfull student is investigated , according to the student behaviour and life , random study times that was set by her/hisself could be determined .  In conclusion it could be said that successfull people are the people who are not afraid of making mistakes and in addition to these who are not to take risk . They are always ready to find out something and development . But as comparised above , to do wahot is wanted does not bring any success and olso a comfortable life we imagine . If life is just like a stairs for people having beauties confort miney on the upside , in my opinion successfull people will go up easily but the others will not .	TUR
This is a really common theme for these periods . Young people most of the time are not interested to help and to develop the community in which they live . Just a small part of them is really interested at the topic . Often this new generation is selfish and it is worried to satisfy their needs instead to open their mind to the community . I can say that many things are changed during these years , in the past the people s commitment was much more developed and felled compared to these days . My parents , my grandparents really believed in the possibility to create a better place to live , moreover they tried with a lot of efforts to improve activities that could let the community be a better place . There were the trust that something could change if you are really interested in what is around you .  Nowadays i think that the reponsability to take care of the community is disappeared at all - young people think that is not their problems being worried about the community enhacement , thus the common believe is that just the governament has to promote and support it . Furthermore the young people are not interested in this aim because there is not for them a clear return in terms of money or materialistic benefits . This generation has lost the beuty in believing on the power of the ideas . They do not fight anymore for an idea but just for themselves .  An example of the difference between the past and the current days could be provided by a short story told me by my granfather In the 1940 my grandfather was very interested to the problem of our town . He was a person that has tried to improve the economical condition of our city and to develop the spirit for the community . In that period in my small city thre were not a cinema . The citizens of that time complained most of the time for this kind of lack , even because in that period the cinema was something new and it appealed most of the people . My grandfather was the one who invested money and finally bought the first cinema odf my town . Everbody can remember him firstly as a good person a then as someone who did at least some efforts to take care of the community .	ITA
I disagree with the statement . for me , being successful has very little to do with the amount of material things one has accumulated . To be successful , one has to be happy . the two things go together . One might say it is possible to achieve both things , but i thing for that one would have to dedicate most of his or her time for that purpose . To try new things and take risks rather than doing what one already knows how to do well , time will pass one by . Therewill be no time to enjoy the success . Success is doing what one loves , doing it well , make agood living out of it while enjoying the rest of the time with the persons you love . What will being loaded with material things if you do n't have time to supervise your children school progress / Definitely , I would rather be very good in what I do , do it well , make a good living from it and enjoy life afterward with family , friends , loved one instead of trying new things over and over again ,	FRE
There are a lot of reasons and facts that agree with that statement but there are also facts that do not agree with it . In the following I will first talk about young peolpe like teenagers and then old people and after come to a reasonable conclusion .  Young peolpe quite enjoy their life since they are very activ and energetic . They have the power to party and have fun for most of the time . The main factor I would say that they enjoy life more than old ones is because they do not have that many responsibilties and worries in life as old people . They are helped financiallz and mentally by their parents so they do not have to work or suffer in any kind of dispute like this . Another reason that they enjoy life more is that they probably have so many things to try out and so many places to visit , since everything is better when you try it for the first time , they have a big advantage there .  Old people though have also a lot of reasons to enjoy life at its maximum . If you have been a nice and fun person throughout your life which could mean that you could have more friends than younger people since you have more experience in friendships than them .  When you are an adult , you have a lot more freedom than younger people . So you can do things that they can not do , for example small incidents like going on vacation without anyones permission or making a decision that can affect your whole life style .  In my opinion I agree with that statement because even though youg people are more limited in doing things , it is much more fun and exciting . And you do not have to worry about that many things like your future , your job or your financial status .	TUR
Yes , I agree with the statement `` its more important to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts . ''  I feel its very important for us to understand an idea than simply knowing it . If you are good at understanding ideas and concepts then you can make yourself think of the facts pertained to it . An idea when brought into implementation , then it can be known about the good and bad associated with it , there bymaking us to think about the facts related to it .  I feel the sequence related to this idea concept is , firstly generation of an idea is important and is folowed by its analysis , this is made in our brain thinking about its results . nextly , its implementation and there by deriving the facts out of it . So , the fact can be derived from the concept itself .  In my opinion , simply learning facts without knowing any information regarding will be like `` eating food without knowing what it is ? '' The food that you are eating may be tasty and you are enjoying it but withou knowing what are you eating seems foolish .  In this contemporary world understanding ideas and concepts is in existence . So , when the world is running if you still continue to be lethargic its not good on your part and you cant do justice to your profeesion .  Understanding an idea makes a person think about it there by making him develop or innovate new ideas regarding the topic . It enables man to be thought-provoking always . Knowing the fact will be a part of the this process if a person adopts a habit of understanding the concepts and there by filling the essence of the studying .  Thus , i feel its more important for a student to understand concepts and work upon them mindful that he is also filled with the fact along with the idea .	TEL
Many people prefer to take a trip alone without tour guide . They say that they do like it because they want to avoid people , planned moving and take a break with self-time . Although it is suitable reaons , traveling in a group with a tour guide has many advantages that deserves we should do it . Not only group touring can reduce danger in abborad nations , but also it is really convinient and make us visit essential points .  First of all , group touring with tour guide includes less danger of tripping foreign countries than tripping alone . Since people are not familiar with foreign nations , there are much danger of frauding or any accidents . For example , many Koreans are frauded by foriegners during East Asia trip . It includes muders , robbing and so on . Moreover if there are accidents in foreign countries , people usually embrassed so they can not do properly . However , since guides are usually people of that country , they well know about country 's conditions and situations so dangers decrease much .  Next , group touing is really comfortable and help us to see essential places . Since tour companies already make plans and reservate completely , people can enjoy journey with only following schedules . For instance , It is needless to say that there are no danger to lack of hotel rooms because companies already booked them . Moreover , as stated above , guides knows well about that country , so he can bring us to most famous and beautiful places .  As I mentioned above , group tour led by a tour guide has many advantages . It contains less dangers because we doing group and led by tour guide . Also , it is convinient since companies already make a schedule about trip , only we should do it is following plans . Therefore I agree with that the statement , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .	KOR
I partially agree with the given statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' because young people enjoy life by playing with the friends , by watching latest movies , by going to colleges , by teasing the younger people etc . . where as the older people enjoy life be sitting at home , chatting with the people surrounding , going to piligrim places etc . .  The younger people now a days had a lot of fun life to have for example if we consider the case of my brother he enjoys a lot . he goes to college on bike , he meet friends every day evening , he will have a big chat with them about movies , he then go to his classmates house to have a fun time with them about the funny things happened on that day , finally he comes to home have a good meal and then he goes to sleep .  If we take the case of the older people they have work to be done , for example if we the case of my grand mother she is quite relaxed , she use to gather the other people and she start chatting the whole day it is a kind entertainment for her , she watch old devotional movies with them enjoy feeling about god , some times she used to go to piligrim places like tirupathi , shirdi etc . . she use to eat the the she interested , she used to spend money as she wishes .  I think both the younger people and the older people both enjoy life very much but not compared to each other they enjoy in their own way according to their age . If we consider the real time facts to better understand of this concept we just consider a normal teen age person who used to go to collede or some other jobs they lead their life in luxurious way thinking that this is the age which is not going to come similarly way if we consider the life the older people they just wanted to enjoy their life in the end days so they enjoy their life as they like and also other people of the will cooperate for that .  so i partially agree with the given stat	TEL
Before attempting to give a definit answer to that question I would like to discuss the pros and cons of the group let by a tour guide . I will then conclude summarizing the different points made .  First of all , lets ask ourselves why do people use tour guides to travel . A possible answer to that question might be that people do not necessarily have a lot of time to visit a certain place , and therefore intend to make the most out of their time . In that case , people are shown the most popular monuments and locations for sightseeing by their tour guides , and visit as much as possible in a short amount of time . So I personaly think that in the case of a short trip , it is a good solution in order to see the main things to see .  However , the major drawback of this alternative appears to me to be that as you intend to make the most out of your limited time , every visit is carefully timed and scheduled . Therefore , in the event that you would like to learn more about a certain monument or place , it turns out to be quite difficult as the group might be already leaving for the next visit , or you just might not have enough time ahead of you to do so . Consequently , if a deep understanding of a certain place or monument is the major concern of the trip , tours appear to me not to be the best alternative , making such a wish difficult to come true .  To conclude , I believe that groups led by a tour guide can be both a good or less good alternative depending on the major aim of the journey . In my opinion , if the thourough understanding of a certain monument or place is the objective , then a different alternative should be taken . However , if the objective of a short journey is to go around the main sightseeing spots , then I beleive it is the alternative to adopt .	FRE
Many products are advertised in TV because it 's the main media nowsaday . Many people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , others believe that most advertisements put the products as they really are . I think that advertisements make products to seem better to make more money , atract more people and exapand their bussines  One reason is to make lot of money . Many of this owners do n't have any respect for others . These persons just want to buy you something for a high price and maybe the price is lower than they said it is . Like my grandfather . She wanted to buy a computer and she saw an advertisement on TV that said that the computer worth three thousand dollars . Because she was naive in computers , she bought it . When she told to my father that she bought a computer fotr that price , my father almost kill her because he said that the computer only worth one thousand dollars .  Another reason is beacuse the owner wants to atract people with this product . They just car to atract the maximum quantity of people . For example , my mother bought a vacuum machine that she saw on TV . She said that this was the best one that she have aver seen . When the vacuum arrived , she was excited and she started to use it . In four days the vacuum broke and she could n't use it anymore .  Finally , this advertisements make products better because the owners want to expand their bussines . For this reason they can sell more things and also make maore money . First they start selling only one product but with the money they made with this product , they will start making other products as a result , they will expand their bussines .  To conclude I would say that many advertisement make products much better than really are because the owners want to make more money , atract more peolpe and expand their bussines . I think that these people should have more respect whith their customers and make advertisement to show the product the way they are and not the way they want to look like .	SPA
Nowadays , there are many advertisements . We also buy products as we see many advertisements . When we see advertisements , we may feel that we must buy the products . Some people belive most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are but others do n't believe . Given the choose between first and second opinion , I choose the first opinion .  First , advertisements use the visual aspects . In detail , in case of the paper advertisements or Internet advertisement , the products can seem much better in respect of color , size , shape , etc . For example , a week ago , I ordered the clothes on the Internet site because the clothes are beautiful pink that I like . I was so excited and expected . Yesterday , the clothes was finally delivered but when I saw the clothes , I was quite disappointed because the clothes was ugly densed pink that I loathe . So , following the example that visual aspect , advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Second , in case of home shopping , the cast introduce the product . To illustrate , my aunt called my mother a few days ago , and my mother told me about the story of my aunt . I will tell this story . A few days ago , my aunt watched TV home shopping channel about kimchi . The cast ate the kimchi so deliciously and said that kimchi was so yammy . Futhermore , all guests ate kimchi so deliciously and in my aunt 's opinion , it look so delicious because of the spiced color of the kimchi and eater 's attitude . So , my aunt ordered the kimchi but when my aunt ate the kimchi , taste is very bad and disgusting .  On top of that , most companies apply their products ' prize and prestige in the contests in advertisements so we believe and buy the products that but these may not be true .  To sum up , by above reasons and examples , I think the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .	KOR
I disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . In my opinoin , enjoying the life is to be peaceful in the innerside and live everyday without regrets , then make yourself happy . In this regards , I suppose that the real life for self usually starts when a people has his own work and financial independantly .  First of all , it is different from the young people , who literally relys on their parents for their experditure , the older people are indepence and pay all of their experditure by themselves . Therefore , they can spend whatever they like and wherever they like to go at their own means .  Besides , after having earned the experience from the life , most of people have their stable goals for life and own interest . So , the process of presuing their goals and interest is the time of enjoying their lives .  At last , especially for the elder people , who are retired and free of the responsibilities to raise their children work for daily expenditure , have more time to enjoy the life .  To summary , although the older people have more responsibility in life , they can also enjoy life as the same as the young people do for their indepedance and maturally .	CHI
I agree with the statement that most advertise show more facts of the products than they really have and make it much more easy to be saled . This phonomenen are showed almost all over the world and I think it is reasonable to be accept .  The first reason is that , the advertise is mean to show the good effects of the products and appeals people to buy them . It is the use of the advertizing . People who make advertise always study the merchanes carefully and make it more useful and more worthful to buy . They of cause will show a lot of unconvince facts to be convinced . Just even a piece of papper can be discribed to have the capability to make user more healthy than use other kind of pappers . You may think it is rediculers , but the advertise offen make those problems .  Second , the company pay for the advertisement is focus on the profits of it . The company do this things just because it want to increase its sales and make more money back . Input and output is the first thing to a company . So the manerge people want to make the products more attractable to the market . And the advertise will be as better as it could be . No concern about the facts . There are many illigle advertises in China that misleading people and make terrible effects to the society .  The last reason is , sometimes , people are like to see some amazing things in the advertisement though they do not believe it . For example , a women who is not so fit may want to see some medicines that can help people to lose weight . And she may dream that she could be as beautiful as the ficture shown at the advertisement . She dose not want a really product , but just a dream .  So the advertisement offen seem much better than they really are and accepteble to the society .	CHI
Personally , I think that this statement is a perfect reflect of what I think and do , I have always thought that you have to understand everything that you are taught . This is a very controversial topic , but I think I have a clear panorama of what I think .  The first reason for which I incline to this decision is for the fact that learning facts do n't give you an internal satistaction of a certain topic . There is a famous quote stated by Ignatius of Loyola S.J. which is : `` The knowing does n't satisfies the soul , but the interpretation and likeness of the things internally does '' . This is a very reflexive quote , because when you learn a fact you do n't adquire it 's concept completely , you have like an empty space . For example in philosophy , you can know the point of view from every philosopher , but if you do n't understand them , you could never know what they really meant .  The second reason is that human brain tends to forget easily things learned but not interpretated . For example , the things that you learned in 9th grade , sometimes you forget them when you are in 10th or 11th , because you do n't really get the concept completely . On the other hand , if you learn something and you understand it well , you will remember it for ever , or if you forget it , with a little thinking you will remember it and could use it right for other aspects in your cotidian life .  Finally , I would like to say that people who always memorize facts and do n't understand them completely , usually have less resources for having success in life , because of their lack of understanding and interpretation in essential manners . However , people who really understands all the things that they are taught , usually develop an ability to solve problems faster , or be more original in their thinking .	SPA
I do agree with the statement that advertisements do make you feel that the product advertised is better than what it actually is . The reason is that it uses people that are famous , perfect results , incredible situations , and many more to make their product look better than they really are .  In advertisements they always make claims of excellent results . For example in an ad for a fairness cream it might claim that it will make you fair in six weeks but when you actually try it out the results are not as spectacular as the ad claims . Thus the ad makes the product seem better than it actually is .  Another way by which advertisements make their product look better is that they use star power . That is they hire either a big movie star or a sports celebrity to endorse their product . This attracts the public to the product without really paying all that attention on the product . Thus the product will seem better to you just because a particular star is using the product . It will not matter to you if the product is not really all that good . What does matter is that your favourite star is using it . Thus star power helps enhance the product and make it seem better than it actually is .  Also in advertisements , many times , the model is able to do incredible things after using the product . For example the ad might show that after drinking their product the model is able to do incredible stunts . These stunts will make the product and the people who use it look cool and it will very much appeal to the young male population . They would only want to use the product , as it is associated with cool people and they would also want to become cool people . Thus the product is made to look better than it actually is .  Last but not least the ads barely mention the disadvantages of using their product . For example in an ad for mutual funds the disadvantage is mentioned so quickly that the viewer barely pays attention to it . Thus drawing attention only to its good points .  Thus advertisememts make their products look better by using star power , claiming exaggerated results and many psycological tricks .	HIN
`` Jack of all trades , master of none '' This is a saying a lot of us grew up listening to . The question is whether you want to be a Jack of all trades or the `` King '' of one .  Personally , I believe , that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad , abstract knowledge about many . When you specialize in one subject , you gain a lot of knowledge and authority on that subject . This can lead to a lot of advantages .  Firstly , mastery in one subject can help you with your career . If you have complete command over your subject , you can effectively utilize it to further your career goals . For example , in a competitive industry like the Information Technology industry , if you have a good grip on your domain , it will benefit you much more than having incomplete knowledge about a lot of other domains . If you are knowledgable about a subject , not only can you do your own work better , but you can also help your colleagues or peers with problems they may be facing .  Specialization in a subject makes you an authority on it . This can lead to other people looking at you for direction or help if they are stuck . So not only do you become more popular , you also gain a lot of respect by helping others out .  Lastly , i would say that if everyone just wanted to have broad knowledge on a variety of different subjects , then no scientific or other development would ever have been possible . Take Leonardo Da Vinci for example . Had he not developed his skill in painting to such a high degree , we would not today have been able to exclaim at the beauty of the Mona Lisa . Or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who with his skill in music , gave us so many beautiful compositions . Or Albest Einstein , whose immense study of scientific phenomena lead to so many inventions .  In conclusion , I firmly believe that it is much better to specialize in a subject you feel passionately about than to have a lot of unimportant data on subjects you might be just mildly interested in .

In my opinion , I do n't suppose that the number of cars will be declined in decades . Cars are necessary for the human society since 20th century . The cars play an important role in human history . Also being a culture symble , cars means safty and convinent in our life . These all made the depands and demands of the car never vinished .  Moreover , the would wide populations are still increased nowadays . The large populations , and the related growthes of it in the past years implied that the reduces of the vehicles is impossible . Then , car industry is a very important income of the big country all over the world . It is very hard to change the composition of the industry in simply twenty years . Scientist and engineering are dedicateing to improve the cars using morden technologies . More and more high efficient , green technological cars are still emerged . The pollutants of the cars are potential to be reduced signficantly in the near future .  However , some opposites mentioned the development of the new vehicles . There might be some substitution of the cars in the near furture , such us the development of the mass transportation . But do n't think that will result the reduces of the car . More and more emerged industry stimulate the development of each other indeed .  The descover of the new energy , such as the achol or gases , implies that cutting edge of the new cars will be more and more important in the near further . The urgent development of the cars , and the related technologies could be expected to enrich the human dai	CHI
I absolutely agree with the statement . Moreover , I think that good advertisements should enhance the appearance of efficiency to maximize the influence on the consumer .  Advertisements for skin care products are especially good at twisting reality . They usually employ models that have immaculate skin regardless of the product . Then they follow the usual recipe by showing the model using the product and telling the audience how big of a change it made on her . It does n't take long for the audience to react to this display of cause and effect . The problem is that the product probably did n't have any impact on the model whatsoever : she had perfect skin beforehand . And that 's not even mentioning the computer enhancements . ..  However , I think one thing must be realized : the advertisement that I described previously did its job . It implanted a seed in the consumer 's mind and the sales will happen . That 's exactly the purpose of marketing : generating sales . I think it 's largely the consumer 's responsibility to train itself to mostly ignore advertisements . We know that they are fake , so why do we believe them anyway ?  Do n't get me wrong : advertising is a regulated business and as such should limit itself to what has been ruled acceptable by society . Laws exist that forbid telling lies or deceiving the customer in an advertisement . Building on my previous example , if the skin care product has a real potential for reasonably improving the appearance of skin , then it is the consumer 's task to discern what is real and what is embellishment . As long as the advertisement does n't guarantee the same exact results on everyone , the marketing firm is on pretty safe ground .  I 'll conclude by attacking the other point of view : how could anyone disagree with the original statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ? That 's the way it is . To anyone who believes advertisements display the whole truth unmodified , I have a bridge I 'd like to sell to you . ..	FRE
I somewhat disagree with the statement because I believe that although it may be important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it is more effective for your future career if you specialize in one specific subject .  For example , in school I learned about many subjects including science , mathematics , drama , music , history , photography , ethic , etc. , which served me as basic knowledge for my day to day live . After I graduated I decided to study marketing , and I made a bachelor in business administration with a concentration in marketing . Therefore I had to take finance and accounting clases , additional to the marketing concentration clases . I was n't as happy with the accounting and finance clases , as I was with the marketing clases , but I believe that it is imortant for me to have at least a general knowledge of other related subjects . This two courses served me as a supporting base for what I learned in marketing because it 's related . And `` related '' is the clue word here . I do n't find its necessary for me to study a little bit of medicine , architecture and politics in the university , just to have a broad knowledge in many subjects . For me it 's more important to concentrate in subjects related to my major if that 's where I want to work in my future . That 's why I 'm planning to do now a master degree , to even concentrate more and learn more in the studied before .  Therefore , I conclude that learning about other subjects it 's usefull for your day to day live and general knowledge , but as you get older I believe you should concentrate more in the subject you want to work with . Specializing in one specific subject makes you a `` pro '' in it , and It is better to be a `` pro '' in a subject than to be a `` mediocre '' in many subjects .	SPA
Should we learn or should we understand ? This question may have been a debate for ages . Everybody wonders if he had better to learn or to understand . But could we really understand without learning ?  I agree this the statement , because I really think that it is not always helpful to learn by heart . I think it is more important to understand something and to develop our critical judgement . But both are really important .  Nevertheless , I think we should learn in order to be able to understand what happen is our life or in our society . Let 's take an example . If we want to understand a politic debate or we want to vote . We should know and learn what is a republican or a demorcrate , in order to vote right . In our life , we always need to know something to understand it . Thus the importance of learning .  However , we should be carful of not learn without understanding , which is completly stupid . An example may be when somebody has well learned how to write words . If he does not practice or understand how to make a sentance , it is completly useless to know words .  Despite the fact that learning by heart something could be very boring , we should be able to do it . Because the more we will have learned a subject , the more we will be able to talk about it and to understand it . So if we learn how is the american parliament , we should better understand the role of G. Bush for example .  Therfore , I think that we should not decide only to understand or only to learn . These two notions should go together , they are complementary . Although nobody really like to learn by heart , we must do it , in order to understant better what happens in our life or in our societz .	FRE
I disagree with the statement . It mat be true that the group tour is a most convinient way to travel because a tour guide know a lot about the place and there seems no waste time thanks to the all well prepered plan . However I think that to travel by ourselves is more enjoyable than group tour and there are three reasons that support my idea .  First , by traveling individually , you can go anywhere at anytime . For example , if you go to one tourrist attraction in a group and you find the place attracting , you have to just pass through and can not see the place well because of the time limit .  Next , you can meet local people . If you are in a group tour , local people are not interested in them because you already have a lot of conpany and the local people see you as one of them . However , if you go to the sight alone , it draw local people 's attention and they might talk to you or at least nice to you . Moreover since they live there , they knows where to go better than guides or guidebooks . In addition , you can know what the tradition and cultures of the region , which the guidebooks do not tell you .  Finally , you can be independent . To travel alone is not always just a fun . There are a lot of danger around you . However you can learn how to protect yourself when you are in danger . what you learned from the dangerous situation will be helpful for your latter life .	JPN
In rapidly chaing world , it is clear that those who are not unerstand ideas and concept are unlikely to succeed . some arguee that it is ideal to learn facts . however , i agree that it is unrealistic to learn fact .  because , doing so prevent them developing thier knowledge and finding more rational facts .  First . learning facts do not increase thier knowledge . this is because if people learn facts . they become weary of the facts . which makes it difficult to develop thier ceative knowledge . for example , recent study shows that students who learn facts produce knowledge 30 percent less than students who understand ideas and concepts .  this is because students become fed up with simply facts . it make them dull . as a result , learning facts prevent students from develping their knowledge .  Second , understanding ideas and concepts help students find more rational facts . this is because they can find more rational facts from experience to understand . for instance my son has learned from learning facts to understanding ideas . I disappointed whenever he do not understand principle of something . however , after he change the method of learning to understading ideas . he finding more rational facts . if he had chosen to learn facts . he would not have been able to find more rationl facts .  In short . it is impractical to learn facts fot students . since it lead to lower knowledge . furthermore , experiece to understand ideas and concepts help them find rational facts . although it 's easy to learn facts . it prevent them growing thier professional lives .

I disagree on having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .  I feel that we should narrow down our choice of subject rather than increasing the knowledge on all subjects widely .  We all study for a better career and when we get out of the university people ask for specific skills and we should be the best among our skills to get the job . If we start having a broad knowledge on many academic subject instead of concentrating on what your career exactly needs we will loose the race in the job hunt .  We all know the famous quote `` Jack of all , King of none '' now thats what would happen if we start gaining knowledge on many subjects rather than one . We would no doubt increase our knowledge but unless we specialize on all of them its of no use .  I would cite an example of myself , I always wanted to be a software engineer and there is heavy competition out in the market for software jobs . If I had not taken up software as my major in my university I would not have made a job . No software industry wants a person who knows 10 subjects but is not specialized in software .  But at the same time I insists we should know a bit of other subjects too for the sake of our general knowledge and to live in this world . In our school we read about everything like maths , science , geography , history , etc , . , and thats enough for us to know on many academic subjects . Once we come out of school and join a university we should start focussing on one particular area of intrest which would ultimately give us satisfaction and better career prospects .  I would like to conclude by saying that specializing on one subject is always more fruitful than learning about a lot of subjects .	TEL
I agree with this idea that charenging new things and do n't care about fault . There are two reasons : trying are profitable and newtings have usually fault and it needs to growth .  Firstly , charenging can proceed tecnology and deveropment . For example , the history of devepropping supace tecnology were faced to many faults . In order to bing out human to the speace , many fault roket lunching were happend . The space deveropping are typical of try new things and overecome risks .  Secondary , If you do the same thing ordinary , it is impossible to growth . For example , although you learned something in the school , you do n't take for the imformation , the imformation became an invain . People have desire to know new things by nature and they use the fommer imformation . If they do n't try newthings , the life area would be narrow by now .  Threfore , I believe worth activities that people chanenge new things and do n't worry fault .	JPN
Many people in this modern world wonder if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . In my opinion , i think successful people are the people who try new things , but in the end it has its advantages and its disadvantages .  I think that successful people are the people who try new things because these people work hard , research and try there best to find new things as well as getting things better and more efficent so i guess these people deserve to get more than the people who are just sitting in their places , repeating the same procedure again and again through out the years . Successful people in my opinion never stop the hard work , never stop researching as well as never stop or speed down the pace from looking for the better and the best as this modern world is modernizing , and improving day after day so you have to be on the pace and never stop from working hard to find new things . Always a person , who stops or slow down his pace in researching and working hard , will be thrown out of the competion .  There are few disadvantages of trying new things and one of them is that by trying new things you may risk yourself , as for example if the new thing did not work or benifit it will cause failure and sometimes may cause great lose to a specific person or even company . In my opinion , some times trying new things is worth the risk as the percentage of success is much higher than the percentage of failure in most times .  Some advantages of doing what you already know , which are few is that you do not risk your self in danger , it keeps you out of the red zone and into the green zone . In my opinion , people who dont like competition , facing , and people who do not have strong hearts stay doing what they already know how to do well in .  Finally , successful people always try to find new things while people who want to stay in their places and not change keep doing what they already know how to do well in and i am a person who think successful people are who try new things and bare the risk .

Athough people enjoyment differs from stage to stage , youth enjoys more as compared with the older people is definitely reasonable to agree with the statement . I observed in my life at part , that young people enjoys more .  In modern world , due to the development of technology , they are more fascinated to new kind of objects , such as mobiles , computer , internet , etc. , and by using them that were available enjoying life .  Youngers are more affectionated to the day to day development of technology , by using those things they enjoying more . Older people are not that much aware of these technologies . Because technology is developing rapidly in these day to day life . Younger ones are more energetic than older people , they can go and do whatever they want . They make their friends as a part to enjoy in most of the public places , they usually attends party and meetings , and have capability to think and improve by adapting new technologies they enjoys more .  Older people are mostly feels that they enjoyed in their younger stages , let us allow their children who are in younger stages would allow them to enjoy , because most of the life has come to end . While coming to oldage , people thinks that they can not enjoy because they usually suffers with most of the health problems like heart attack , blood pressure , sugar , bone problems . Today , the development of industries and factories as well as increasing pollution with people making them to live life upto an extinct , get affected to many diseases makes most of the older people think to that they can not enjoy their rest of life .  In most of my experience , older people allows them to enjoy more as well as to get awareness of the social life .	TEL
Advertisement is invading our life . Wherever people drive their eyes either on the Tv or in the streets , the advertising campaigns are overwhelming our landscape making them full of expectations for the products they admire on the screen or in the newspaper . But , unfortunatelly , most advertisements promise more than they can really deliver to the final customers . The strenght of the marketing system of the multinational companies brands make people dreaming too much and the final customers are not very aware of the image technicity comapnies uses for making their produtcs more beautiful .  The message an advertisement wants to convey to the final consumer is delicately composed by the marketing system of the multinational brands . The marketing allows the companies to sell dreams through their products campaigns . For example , the consumer does not feel guilty to buy and dring too much Diet Coke because it is said to be produced with less sugar than the original one . Similarly , the ones who buy electronics machine to do sport at home in order to get slimmer dream of being fit by using the machine promoted by the ad .  Moreover , people neglect too much the capacity of the computerizing of the image . This occurs especially in the cosmetics industry where the brands show off the merits of their products . They build beutiful advertisement campaigns with top models who display a beautiful skin quality , which is the result of computer works .	FRE
I think that successful people try new things and take risks is a good working to do . I will write about reason why . I will give some experience .  in my case when i was young , I ca n't to do everything . my parent help to me everything . But when I growing up , I want to try something to do . because I have wonderring that problem . So I had to do . I found that problem . I mean that I solutuion problem by myself . also my father is samething . my father have been failed business , but he does n't forgiven . He was tried other things , keep going work . finally he succesed his business . I want to say do n't forgive , keep trying to work .  I will write another story . eveybody know about Tomas Edison . when he was childhood , everybody said , `` stupid , foolish '' . also his parent worry about him . someday bring an eggs . He said , `` i can do chichen mom , comes baby '' . He was kept to wonder something , and try to do . eventually , He successed his work . we know about light . he was discovered by himself . Anybody can try to do or do n't scared new things .  In conclution , I think that successful people has exactly reason . Thoes things are that they are not scare new thing and take risk . keep try to experience and challenge . we need to learn about their life or life style .	KOR
This essay is about products and advertisment . Do most advertisments make products seem better than they really are .  First of all we should think about advertisment and its goals . Nowadays , advertisments are used very commonly to support the selling process of a product . There are advertisments on tv , in newpapers etc . Advertisment is a special part of Marketing and it gives the possibility to show a new product to possible customers . Its main goal is to attract new customers for a particular product . The customer should think positive about this product and buy it .  As I mentioned before , the customer should have a positive impression from the product . To reach that goal , the advertisment will of course just show the strengths of this particular product .  However , some advertisments may not really show the truth of the strengths and weaknesses of a product . I think that these advertisments are a few negative cases .  Another point is that the people from the marketing agencies , who design the advertisments , can not tell the lies about the product . People would recognize that lie just after they both the product and they would never buy a product from that company again .  Companies want to satisfy customers and that wouldn t happen if they show advertisments who are not true .  As i mentioned before , I think that advertisments show the best part of a product without showing the negative parts . However i don-t think that advertisment make products generally better than they really are .	GER
I am agree with the statement that says that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . Infact , I am a student and for me is essencial for learning well facts , first at all try to understand the ideas and the concepts that there are beside the fact that I must learn .  If a person does not understand the why of the facts I think that is not usefull learn about it . In my experiance , I always try to understand the reason that there is beside an event . Becouse I think that if I understand the basic concept it will be more simple learn fact and not forget it .  I study criminology and for my work is basic understand why is happen a certain event , what is the principle cause that causes a certain type of event . For example , for me is not important learn the fact becouse I must understand the reason that ther is beside a certain type of behaviour and not only the result of it .  For my type of study is not important learn the fact but the reason . But I think that is not usefull only for my type of study but for all type of faculty . For example , in the scientific faculty is also very important it . It will be very important understand the reason why happening a certain natural event for example and not learn the events alone .  In conclusion , I think that if a person want understand very well facts and not learn it becouse of the school or becouse a person says that He must learn it , he must question himself the basic ideas and the concepts that is linked on that events . Also if , for example , the event that he must learn is not a good event , and he must try to do in a different way .	ITA
Young people now a days do not spend enough time to help their community .  I agree with the statement that most of the young people of the present generation do not show any kind of intrest to spend atleast little time of their valuable time . Its only because people now a days are enagaged with many thing about themselves that they dont have time to think about the community .  Young people , considering from shcool age to a person who is working or into a bussiness has got his own tensions . Once when he is back from his daily routine work he is tired and wants to spend some time in front of the TV or relax for some time . But he hardly thinks about his communtity or rather about himself .  Comparing to past , our ancesstors and grand parents were always concerned about their family as well as their community . Though they had very less facilties available they made best out of it . With thier communication and interaction with people in the society where as a person of today dosent have time to go and meet his old friends or his relatives atleast .  I think people should be tought to learn about their society and other peple who are living with them in the society so that he can directly look at the people who are no having any facilities and sleeping on the roads so that they make out little of their time and money to protect them and care for them .  I would like to share one of my experience , when i was in my college i saw a man who met with an accident lying on the road with blood flowing , none of them showed any concern to take him to the hospital . .. as they were busy tied up with their own works and that they can not spend liitle time for that old man bcause of which we all had to see him dead on the road . I think such things should not be repeated . Every person should involve in the community help the community in one way or the other as much as he can . this shows his concern for the people and helpiing nature .  Right from the scratch they should be tought about morals and about society , patriotic people , one who learns morals never tries to neglect his society . And every person should take their time in helping the communities .  I have seen many old age people who do a lot for the community , the place where i live we dont have medical services for us for which our area people who were all 55 yrs old grouped together and made a request to that area HEAD that we are in need of a hospital which can help us in odd times for children and people living in this area . They have taken the risk for the community but people who are young were least bothered about this issue as they were much worried about their careers and settlement rather others they were selfish with thier behavior .  I think every individual should take part in doing something for the society this gives him nothing but self satisfaction which is more than anything for a human .	TEL
I dare say that I agree the statement that it is more important for students understanding ideas and concepts than lerning facts . Because ideas and concepts are fundamental value . They must know these values so that they can apply various setting . The values help students to extend their knowledge and skills too .  I am a nursing major . When I was a practitioner , I focused to learn facts . In this situation , the word `` facts '' means some daily routine activities , such as way to clean wounds or skill of checking blood samples , etc . But since medical technology is improving and most of the things are done easily with some equipment , I do n't use the techniques in these days . But we still use our knowledge to analyze the data . Idea and concepts last long .  Then , if I have unerstanding the concept , I can apply the idea to the diffrent situation . If I understand the theory that cultural background affect on people 's behavier , I can understand how to care a forein patient . If students have enough knowledge about fundamental of the area , they can apply it to other situations . It will help them to solve problems they would face .  Moreover , fundamental knowledge helps students to extend their study . If a students wish to study in postgraduate course , the basic knowledge of the related theories are required . If I leaned only daily routine in one ward of one hospital and neglect to study the concept or ideas , I could n't continue my study for the mastral digree .  Therefore , I support the opinion that students should make higher priority to undestand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . They are basic values which last long , can be applied to different scenes and can be used for brushing up the level of study for students .	JPN
I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The people who develope an advertisement usually try to communicate a certain message which is supposed to make the product attractive to the customer . Everything that does not comply with this message is simply left out . Most of the time , the producers do n't care about being truthful in that matter . Let 's take cigarettes as an example . If the producers want to make cigarettes attractive to the customer , they will not talk about all the negative side effects , but instead they will focus on the advantages . They simply keep important information to themselves even though it might hurt the person who is going to buy the cigarettes . This way , the customer will be blinded by the positive attitude of the advertisement and will be led to believe that it would be good if he bought cigarettes .  This kind of commercial strategy is actually widely used in the promotion of food . Many companys want to make their products look healthy because nowadays many people try to stay slim . The advertisement producers answer to that need by developing the commercials in a way that will make the product seem healthy and good for fitness oriented customers . Usually they exaggerate certain ingredients which actually only make up a minor part of the product . Some commercials for example promote chocolate bars which include `` a great deal of milk '' even though there are merely traces of milk found in the product .  Another way to make customers buy a product is to appeal to certain images they have of themselves . Commercials for beer for example usually try to convey a sense of manlyness to the watcher . Men usually feel that this kind of beer will make them seem more rough and therefore more attractive to women even though the brand is not special in any way and does not differ much from other beer brands .  All those means are used by the companys in order to make more profit regardless of the effects it might have on the customers .	GER
In these society , most people will spend for 6 to 12 years in different school to study . The main purpose is to gain konwledge . While some students think to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts , so they just learn to understand . I do n't agree with that . I think the facts of konwledge is importand as well as the ideas and concepts . The two con not be without in the process to study .  First of all . we should konw the purpose of study really . Everyone konw that the purpose is to gain konwledge . But what will we do use the konwledge ? We should use the konledge to become out sklls and abilitise , which could use in the work and real life . For example if a student thinks understand idase and concepst is more important than to learn facts . He will easly ingore the significant of the facts . And then do n't like to learn them . After the student graduate , they just master many different concepts , but he is difficult to find a good job . Becouse he can not use his konledge in the work . So learn fact is very importan for the students ' future .  On the other hand , learn facts is also a good way to help the student to understand the ideas and concepts . As we all konw , most of the ideas and concepts are consist of words and fomulars . They are verg boring for students . While when the student leare the ideas and concepts , the teacher tell them some facts about the concepts . The student will become more interesting and understand the boring concepts more quickly . So the fact iis good for the student to learn .  The last but not the least , students can learn some experisence and lestens from the facts . The facts are some events , somethings happened in the past or some example of unsuccess . These is very important . If the sutents do n't learn some experiences from the facts , they will learn in the future by themselves , maybe form the falure .  From all above , I can draw the conclusion that learn facts is very important for students . Everyone can not ingorne them .	CHI
I totally agree with the statement which states `` it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . According to me , To understand ideas and concepts are more important for a student than to learn facts . firstly , to understand the topic for example any topic related to physical science like light . We should know the basic concepts to deal with it and basic ideas like to think ourselves from where actually it is coming i think thats enough to understand the topic . concepts should be more clear like various laws of reflection and rarefraction to use them for further study not about the facts that from where it is orignated etc etc .  After seeing the student prospective we should be clear with the concepts first and the basic ideas like for example taking the ` brain where its never been before about the topic ' . These genrated thought called as ideas . Generating ideas are really brain storming technique which help to increase the morale of a student .  Similarly if a student go in search of a fact there are 9 out of 10 times he will fail . This failure will lead to lower in the morale of a student through which feeling of negativity can comes in his/her mind . This will lead to build up of negative attitude which can hamper his/her future also . Facts are those which we go and try to find after completing our bachelor 's or even after masters . Therefore , at a student age we should only learn the concepts involved .  One more thing i would like to add to make my assumption stronger is that when we appear in any subjective class at school/college level . what our teacher main aim or where they more stress . They stress more on concepts building system then to go in search of a fact . i agree that facts are also required we should know but major focussig point should be concepts and develope student to think beyond the limit .  At the end in a nut shell i would like to say that concepts are the one which makes student more clear about the topic able to judge it properly . these concepts are the major supported element in a student life which help him/her to think more , to create/generate ideas , to be able to get the thing done in more fruitfull way which are basically needed academically and in professional life to .

It has been almost a century since the birth of the cars . And these species have made a tremendous impact into the lives of humans . They have made our lives faster , easier and have helped to spur the industrial growth . However , the technological advancement , the increasing reliance of people on other modes of transport and the more organized lifestyle that this new age is comming up with gives me an impression that over the years the number of automobiles will reduce .  The technology is advancing at a rapid pace . In recent years itself we have witnessed new modes of transport comming up . The howecrafts , the underground rails , the overhead rails , supersonic aircrafts are just a few of them . With such novel and efficient means of transport spriniging up by the minute and with people becoming increasingly reliable on these novel means of transport , we can say for sure that the cars on roads will reduce .  We often read in the daily newspaper reports that new airlines companies are opening up . The Low-cost Airlines have been a big success in Europe and the same model is being tried out in countries like India . People have changed their preferences of travelling from one city to another or from a country to the neighbouring country due to the new form of airlines . This is because these low-cost airlines offer cheap rates , especially to the everyday business traveller and these travellers have such a plethora of options in choosing the cheapest deals . As a result , people have started abondoning car as their mode of transport for short routes . With the success of such airlines it is definite that in near future we will see many more such business models which will ultimately result in the number of cars being reduced .  The organization of society is fast changing . Two major forms establishments are comming up . One , in which the residential and business localities are under one roof and the other in which they will be independent . If such structures are adopted on a world wide basis , then people will have to resort to different modes of travel . In the first case , they will not need to travel and in the second case they will prefer public transport modes such as underground or overhead rails . This is because it will help them reach their workplace faster . This in turn will cause the reliance of people on automobiles .  Thus we see that with the times changing , people have come to rely on various other means of transport which assist them to reach their coveted destinations faster and in a much easier manner . These factors give us an indication that over the years cars will be replaced by many other means of transport . I only hope that like the dinosaurs , these four-wheeled species do not become extinct .	HIN
As a young person myself , I often feel guilty for spending so little time with the community . I had often noticed that the social bonds between neighbors have diminished in recent years , and people are becoming less caring than before . That 's why I think we should definitely spend more time helping our communities .  But how ? The main reason nowadays that young people does n't spend much time with their communities is that they are crammed with homework , extracurricular activities , entertainment , ... etc . They are simply not spending a lot of time strolling about the neighborhood . Without any interactions with their neighbors , young people will easily neglect their role as a member of their community . Although they read about community service in their textbooks , few actually participate in it . And when you ask them why , they simply reply : ` I do n't have time . '  So if we wish to solve this problem , the first thing to do is to decrease the amount of burden on young people . Schools should end earlier so that young people can spend more time inside the community . Teachers should give their students less work on weekends so they could have adequate time to conduct effective community service . Parents should relieve their child of to much activity and they should not force them to go to cramschools . Without these corrections to our education system , schools would end up to actually teach young people not to spend time with the community .  Of course , one might contend that young people will end up spending the extra time playing computers and not doing community service at all . That might be the case for some kids , but in my opinion , if people felt they are involved in their community , they would try their best to make it better . This sentiment can be further enhanced by government propaganda and social education .  It is everyone 's responsibillity to bring young people back to community service . They should not simply put their blame on laziness manifested by the younger generation . I pray for a day when the old bonds between neighbors can be re-established .	CHI
In today 's world , cars are the main kind of transportation used for transportation on land . As the cities grow and distances get longer , people need ways of transportation more and more in everyday life . Therefore , nowadays almost every person that can afford it over 18 and has a lincence owns a car . If you consider the number of people living on this planet , that would make quite a number . However , on the other hand , ways of public transportation are developing , which reduces the necessity for cars . So what will happen in twenty years ?  First of all , there is the fact that to get from one place to another , you need to have a way of transportation . For most people , in the large cities they live in today , it is impossible to get to work or to go shopping or anywhere within walking distance . So , they need to have a car or a way of public transportation . Most people prefer having there own cars and it 's easy to see why : methods of public transportation are slow and unreliable . You never know when the bus is going to come and it 's almost certain that you will be late to wherever you 're going . Also , buses go slow and stop many times for passengers to get on and off . Metros are usually very crowded and it is very uncomfortable to travel squeezed against people that you do n't even know . Taxis are usually very expensive . Plus , if you go grocery shopping , there is no way you can carry all your bags unless you have a trunk to put them into . Picture yourself in a crowded bus or metro with ten bags full of heavy fruits and vegetables , gallons of milk and juice , meat that is about to get spoiled and ice cream that is melting all over the floor . Not very conveniant , nor is it going to work . This is an example of why at least one car is needen for every family .  However , there is the growing problem of pollution and traffic . There are so many cars that it takes you an hour to get home during rush hour when it usually takes fifteen minutes . Plus , when you get to work , or the mall , there is always the problem of parking . Would n't it just be great to go and catch a movie or get a bite to eat in the time you use looking for parking spaces ? That is why shopping malls and working places have started to schedule service buses which will take you directly from home to work or wherever you are going . Also , there is the problem of the oil resources running out , and put that aside , cars heavily pollute the air . So , instead of twenty people going to a place in separate cars , imagine how much it would reduce pollution and traffic if all twenty people used a bus to go there .  My opinion is that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty years . Governments that are aware of the pollution and traffic problem are developing methods of public transportation to encourage their people to use those methods instead of cars . For example , in the United States , carpool lanes have been arranged in big cities like Los Angeles which you can use only if you have more than one passanger in your car . So , in my opinion , the rising public awareness of pollution , the raise in the cost for fuel for cars and the development in public transportation will reduce the number of cars in the future .

In the last century a large number of people get education to have a good situation on their own lives . I am inclined to believe that students must understand the reasons and abilities of their educated lives . Students who get lesson form a professor want to get lots of information that the professor has and it is depend on the understanding of the ideas and concepts of the professor . Regardless to say that students during the education lives should understand the ideas and concepts of their information that they get from their professors .  First of all students who get the lesson from a famous professor should get information of him and they can get their surveys and experiments . After that they understand what he did in his own experimental lives and his ideas and expectations of their work . So in the lesson they can get losts of information from him .  Secondly students who want to work in a survey must think about the concept of the survey . Survey depends on a long time and it is very hard for some people because of their character . Although people who want to create a experiment must be able to wait for a long time . When the students wants to work in a survey they must learn about the system that they use and after that they can be an experimental people from these kind of surveys .  Taking everything into account in the light of the above started reasons understanding of the ideas and concepts of an information is for the students very significant and when they get the ideas and concepts they can earn lots of benefits which can be used for their own lives .

In my opinnion , successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  I regard this statement as true because I have a quite different definition of success .  If somebody is really successful , he/she should not only manage something that he/she is supposed to do but she should always improve his/herself and have an aim to make innovations by the means of self-optimisation . This has a vital role on someone 's career because it would help the person to be realised by other others and promote .  On the other hand I do n't state that should always take risks and alter the ways he/she knows . The time and the place that a person would try new things and take some risks is also very important . If it is a wrong time or place the things can get worse and worse .  For example if your boss gives you an important project that should be prepared soon you should n't take a risk at this situation and you also do n't have the right to do that because you can harm the prestige of the company which you 're working in .  To conclude , I think that one should try new things and take risks after gaining some experiences and feel ready about changes which would make a person sucessfull and admired .	TUR
I disagree with the idea that young people do not enough time to helping their communities for the following reasons ,  First , young people have a lot of concerns about receiveing others respects through contibuting to their comumnities . For example , some Tokyo universtiy students who live near my city nowadays began to clean the river-side . They ususlly come to rive-side to bring up trashes , cans desposed on it . As the result , the river became vey clean . Then the people in the area appreicated to them very much . And they are proud of the activity . This show that young people want to receive respect of others by helping community .  Second , the rise of concern for environment helps young people contribute to their commuities . They have had more chances to learn environmental issues . As the result , young peolpe have more concern to environment surronding them . For example , when I was a freshman in Kyoto university in Japan , there was a lot of lecture about an environment . The universty students often join events conducted by the near-by cities for preserving the environment .  Thus , I strongly believe that young people contribute to their commnity .  Therefore , I am strongly against hte idea that young people do not give enough time to hepling their communities .	JPN
Nowadays , people however their age , are selfish because of the values convey by the modern society and the capitalism values .  Indeed , everybody think about itself so young people have grown in this atmosphere of '' me and myself '' . The life goes fast and we want to pursuit and achieve our plans because today everything is planning per advance and their is no time for a civic behaviour . In addition , the globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identication problem : which communities for which people ? Regarding to the recent events , communities are rivals and fight between them . So , their is no unity in this world why young people would change this by help who and with which means ?  The modern life make young people very nacisic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be usefull . Some will help the oldest and desabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them . Others will comme in an association to create a better life place for their community .  Indeed some association and organisation have social aim in which young want to be involve .  In my case , I really want to represent the Black in France because their is a lack of representativeness even on media , fashion , intellectual and scientist work . So I went to Boucle d'Ebene association which promote African and Caribean entrepreuneurs even if I have my studies and different thing to manage before to help them .  To conclude , I agree with the fact that they is a lack of motivation by young people to involve themselve in social and civic activities to help their communities . In fact , they seem to be over booked by they stuff as school , work , friends , early child . ..  Indeed , nowadays young people have much more responsabilities than fifty years ago ! But the reality is that they is a lot of young which want to change some things in this world by giving time to helping their community . However , sometimes they do n't have the means to achieve their project as to create an association or a company and sometimes , they are dissuaded by the loss ricognition and credit they are given .

Some people prefer to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Others believe that elders enjoy life more . when faced with the decison of who enjoys more , quite a few would claim that young people have more energy to enjoy life more and that is my point . there are numerous reasons why young people enjoy life more . I will explore a few of the most important ones here .  The main reason for my opinion is that young people are at the begining of the life and they have more advantages . Take my father and my brother as example , my father has a lot of responsibility while my brother does n't have any . when my father want to do something new , he should think himself and his family . my brother , in contrast , goes out at night and comes back whenever he wants and he is n't bread earner .  There is another factor that deserves some mention here . People are different . They have different traits , customs , belief and life style . some pfrefer to stay at home when they get older , others go out more than they did when they are young .  Similirly these reason also apply for young people . when we consider that some young people have a lot of responsibility , while other do n't . young people have opportunity to choose what they want . when they have opportunity , they can go for it and they can make the most of it .  it seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because some people are very emotional others very strict and small problems do n't usually get to them . in short , even tough young people have some problems choosing their career , they have more advantages to enjoy life . but that does n't means older people do n't have fun . they do . sometimes more than young people .

I totally agree with the given statement beacause i 've taken broad knowledge from my school till college . I think it is very important to have knowleged about the things around you . Studing or specializing on just one subject is not enough in today 's world . For an example , to become a doctor a student must not only take science classes like bio , chemistry , physics and math , but they also have to take some elective classes aswell ( politics , economis , humanities ) , in order to understand how things work around them .  I 'm an engineering major studnet i 've completed most of my science classes , but i 've also taken classes like history , art , socialogy , which helped me to understand the importance of the other subjects . These classes developed the understanding of other topics like politics , history , socialogy and world religion in me . I was very suprise to know how important these other subjects are in order to understand the nature of our society . After taking all these classes my way of looking/thinking about the people around me or in other words the society that we are living in have changed a lot in a positive way .  Someone who does't get a chance to learn about the other subjects find hard time to get a job , because his knowlege is just on specific subjects . In modern world companies are looking for people who have knowledge of all sorts of field , rather than having knowleged on just one field . For example there is more chances for a computer programmer who also has some kind of background in the field of electronics than the other programmer who just knows about his own programming field .  In my opinion it is really very important for all of us to have a knowledge of all aspects of life . If you go to universities it very common for a student to have double a major that means to have degree in two field . Becasue they know what companies are looking for once they graduate . Thats a kind of having another tool when other doens't work . We should defenately have knowledge of other fields aswell .	HIN
Some peope in Japan say that young peopel give enough time to helping their comunity , however , I agree with the satament that young peopele do not ginve enough time to helping their comunity for the followin reasons ,  First , Youug people can not have enough time to helping their communities because it is harder for yourg people to live on fo theirselves . For example , I have started working in the Goldman Sachs , which is one of the most famous investment bank , in the Tokyo branch in Japan from 1996 . At that time Japanese Economy was the worst of the worst , So it was very difficuit for young peopele to find out and hold even a working place in Japan . Fortunetely , I found a good company to work for , and since then , I had worked for long time every day without long sleep and a lot of rest . Considering this situation , we , young people , can not have enough time to suoport our commynities .  Second , comunities has been decayed themselves . For example , I live in Roppongi , Tokyo , Japan , which is one of the cental districts of Japan . A lot of youg people , who have to work for long time for themselves , live in this area . At this area , each people does not have any idea that a community exists itself . In this circumstance young people do not think to help for the community . So they do not give no time to helping their communitis .  Considering the situations in rural areas , there might be opposite opinion mentioned above . But a lot of young peopel think for the opinion mentioned above . Thus , I strongly believe that young poepele do not give enough time to supporting ther communities .	JPN
The real cliche advertisement is the one in which a beautiful young woman is eating a great yogourt in a terrific place such as a nice desert island . Indeed very often the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it is actually .  This is really true when we talk about advertisement for goods such as food , cars , clothe . .. Hoever it is not really the product that is shown as much better than it is but rather what is around the product . Apparently you always need a cute girl , a handsome guy or a vaste shiny house to make sell a sausage or o Tshirt . So it is more the stuff inconsciously linked to the product than the product itself that is shown as better than it really is .  Nevertheless in some cases the product is not shown as better than it is . In particular when it is an advertising not on goods but on services . For example the advertisments sensibilising on the security on the road , or the ad concerning lending money in a bank or concerning insurances . In those cases the advertisement is more serious and there are less lies .  All things considered I agree that very often the y , butit is not the least surprising and ; ost people are aware of it . The goal is to create a need and to increase the sells .  In a nutshell i would say that aadvertisment is trying to make products seem much better than in the reality but it is oftently true for goods and less for services . But so ; eti ;	FRE
Advertising , which is a tool used by many bussiness experts or techies to gain much more profits and also reputaion . The art of advertising brought a dramatical change in the marketing world .  The products shown in the `` add '' , the short form of advertising , may not be the same as they really are .  The purpose of advertising is to grab the look of the consumers towards the product . If a product gains the look of the consumers , it may get them buying it . The sample shown in the advertisement may vary with real .  For example , the automobile industry , they show the the performance and accessories of thier product in a speculating way , but the real differs from the shown and also during the advertisement , they make an asterisk mark on the mileage or any other they show , But none observes that , which mean below of that `` under standard testing conditions '' . Generally consumer can not notice that because the font size is very small .  Not only the automobile , lets take the financial area . In this the finanace companies show thier plans of insurance are much better among the other . They only announces the benifits of the plan but not the risks of the plan . Which is a clever way of cheating the public .  If and only if the company makes a good reputation among the market , it can survive long with profits . To achieve this main objective , the products are shown much better in the advertisement . Ofcourse , there are some products which are real , forexample , the jewellary products which are shown wil bwe the same as the real .  The use of latest technology in photography also one of the cause of this debate . The use of xeon lights makes a product glitter and also the highly sophistcated cameras can capture even trash as a beautiful thing . How ever , I agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .	TEL
I believe most advertisement make products seem better than they really are . This is because the kind of things shown in advertisement do not take account of real life conditions , also to differentiate products from other competitors they are hyped for their goodness .  Firstly advertisement make products seem better than they really are because when advertisement is made they do not account the real life conditions . For example when an advertisement of a bike is shown the advertisers do not take into the account of braking , stopping , idling of the bike when they show the mileage of the bike which is most of the times never turn out to be actually achievable at all . With hyped mileage quoted in the advertisement the product in this case the bike seems to be a better than it is really as it can not deliver the quoted mileage of advertisement .  Secondly companies intentionally make good advertisements of their products than they really are to differentiate their product from the other products which are available of other companies . By doing this they try to create a branding and a niche of their product which is very much smiliar to the other product . Take for example laptop companies like Acer , HP which show about the ease of work , graphics display which would not cause eye strain . But in actuality it does it and is very similar to the other product .  Ultimately advertisements make products seem much more better than they really are .	HIN
When it comes to students learning , the discussion of the issue has become a vogue during the last decade . Considering soial atmosphere today , some people hold the opinion that learning facts is more important for students is superior to understanding ideas and concepts . Others , however , contradict learning facts . Personally , I agree on that understanding ideas and concepts because it has more advantags .  Firstly , thoes people agree on learning forget a universal truth that as a old saying that `` know the smell until you teste it '' . As I remember , the people popular in the society all have strong abilities that can paly a role in their work areas . The abilities can not be learned in the classes , because it needs to have more practise in the real society .  Inaddition , another more essential factor why I advocate understanding is more importan is that learning facts without understan will forget soon . An example I can give the details of the argument : some people like to copy other 's work in order to hand in in to the teacher , but they never understand what the answers mean , because they just learn to do not understand to do . Thus , they could't get the knowlogies .  Of couse , choosing the learning facts also has advantages in some extent . For example , the tescher always give us right answer that could avoid to waste of time ; they also guide us a shortest way to reach the results ; and they do good for us to make a better life ; and so on .  But if all these factors are contemplate , the advantages of understanding idaes and concepts carry more weight than those of learning . To sum up , based on the above discussion , it is obvious to conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning factors .	CHI
I agree with the statement . I think people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . Here is an example why I agree with the statement .  I know a person who became rich man . Actually , he is my grandfather , and died in peace . When he was young , he was good student . He never thought about making money . He just liked to study everything he wanted to know . His teacher thought that he could be a teacher of math because he never got wrong on math tests . So , his teacher told him to have more time in math , but he did n't want to do . He wanted have broad knowledge because he did n't want to study one specific subject . So , he studied and studied , but he could not go to a university because he was so poor . After he graduated from his high school , he wanted to get a job . Many companies did n't want to hire him because he did n't graduate from a university . The companies wanted well-educated people on that time . So , he worked as a darily worker . He was not a formal worker , but he worked hard and hard . While he worked , he still studied everything he could do . After eight years later , he made some money . He wanted to get a own company , so he opened a small market . He already knew about how to do because he studied all the time he could do . He used all knowledges to his market . The market was getting bigger and bigger . He got marry with pritty woman and he opened another market . He opened four markets until he died .  In conculsion , I think It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific	KOR
The definition of enjoyment , the very feeling that brings you joy and happiness may defer from one individual to another . Even though most people enjoy their life in their own way i agree with the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do .  There are various reasons for the opinion i share . Firstly yound people are much more healthier and energetic in contrast to older people . A lot of activities that an individual may enjoy require physical energy . This physical energy diminishes with age in most people . They have to worry about their health at all times since it deterioates with age . They might have a particular activity that the enjoy but it may be restricted due to different reasons . For example an older person who enjoys listening to good music may have a problem with his hearing due to age . Such people are highly dependent on medication which has its share of side effects of drowsiness etc . On the contrary , young people have all the energy in the world to enjoy . They do not get tired easily . They are very enthusiastic and in the best of health at most times . Their lifestyle is at a faster pace as compared to the older generation .  Youngsters can indulge in adventure sports , travelling , partying , eating and drinking without any restrictions which would be troublesome for the aged . Seconly young people are far more independent than older people . They are not dependent on somebody to take care of them . Nor are they dependent to ask someone to drive them to somplace . Moreover the older generation spend a lot of time on worriying about trival issues and restrict themselves experimenting . They are more orthodox in comparison to the younger generation and consider a lot of thing that youngsters refer to as enjoyment as taboo . The older generation by far has more value for money and they believe it in saving it for a later day . Youngsters on the other hand may use up that money for luxury , or for a pleasure activity that will assure him a feeling of fun and happiness .  I conclude the essay by restating my opinion that young people enjoy more in life , and i 'm sure most older people would also claim to having enjoyed more in their youth .	HIN
Car is the best instrument to our convenient life . Most people buy their own car if they are afford it . However , in the future that potrayed like more speedy and comfortable than nowaday in some movies , we may discard our cars and the cars will be just a huge matter of wasting . There are some reasons to explain this opinien .  These days are changing and developmenting faster than past . Some people already have visited out of earth , and lots of saterlites are throwing on the earth . Instead of using cars , they will move away by thir personnal flyng like a plain or themselves . From past time , many people wanted to fly to sky and they finally made an airplain . The more wishs make more developments . Airplain was not our destination , therefore a lot of scientists and dreamers are making the new technologies and fantastic real .  Secondly , the future will be a robot world . We always aspire more comfortable things and already made some features to work instead of us . There are many kins of robot like a working in kitchen or playing with child , even there is a dancing robot . Therefore , most of the lighter productive works as a householding or delivery will be the robots ' . Car will be not needed anymore , and we will just call our personal robots when we need some help to moving or delivery .  Surely , the most useful thing , car is the most succesful asset to humanbeing for long time . We also utilize car nowaday almost in everyday , however , the changing of the periods and technics is more important and influence our life . We can not deter th chan	KOR
`` Fact '' - '' a true statement '' is the literal meaning of this word . Facts are fact which can not be challenged or can never be changed . I believe that learning facts is important but more importantly its the ideas and concepts generated in a students mind which are helpful for a successfully learning . When a student grasps a concept clearly his able to apply his own brain and produce more impotant concepts which is absolutly non - replaceable by anyother thing . I understand , knowing and learning facts is impotant but without a good understanding a students knowledge is crippled , he can not shape his own opinion and originate ideas on his own . His knowledge will be fact based rather than good reasoning .  Its impotant that a student should devote time alone for himself for building and constructing his own ideas , as when he / she steps into the practical world , there one needs to face lot of practical hurdles where facts might not be of any use , take an example when a students grows to become a doctor and is challenged professionaly to deal with some medical issues urgently , I dont think in that situation he can use his / her factual knowledge , because facts will only satisfy his query about the ailment maybe but the treatment would be according to the patients behavior which he has to judge and analyse on his own . Maybe the process is not same as it was there in the text book .  Also a conceptual knowledge always helps a student to progress and build and provide this world with new idea , it might be possible the possible source of information has any kind of discripencies which can only be resolved when cthe concept is clear . Then only a student caqn question and probably will be able to look for an answer on his own rather than waiting for someone else to provide him / her with new set of facts and figures .	HIN
Cars are one of major means of transportation . In fact , when the opportunuties , such as comfort and rapid access to locations , it provides is considered , it is the inevitable vehicle of people . Although some people may argue that cars cause certain problems such as crowdedness or air pollution , I do not foresee any change in the number of cars in use in the coming twenty years .  It is debated that cities are so full of cars that in the near future people can not use cars due to the crowd . Besides , the traffic jam that cars create is proposed a solution by decreasing the number of cars . But one should also take the vital importance of cars to human life into account . Cars are integrated to the life style of people . It is used ubiqutiously in public life . People go to work or urgent patients are delivered to hospital by cars . In fact , car is a symbol of civilization .  A second point hat cars lead to problem is the air pollution . Exhaust gases are thougt to cause air pollution and greenhouse effect is triggered . It is true but this does not mean that number of cars in use should decrease . This problem can be solved by changing the energy source cars utilize . For example , solar energy of hydrogen energy can be considered as alternatives .  In conclusion , in my opimion , number of cars in use is not expected to decrease . In stead , it becomes more wide spread , however the source of energy cars consume may change .	TUR
I do agree with the statement of successful people has to try new things and take new risks . Since the beggining of human life , the human had always to explore new things in order to survive to addapt the different changes and the different enviroments that surround us , the world and everything around us is in constant change .  Think how it will be the world today if we continue to be only doing what we already know how to do well , we will probably be pre-historic , if no writting , no paper , no wheel , no medicine has ever existed , we will probably be extinguish by now .  The pre-historic man did n't talk or have clothes but in order to live he started wearing the fur of the animals he haunted , the human now can survive the cold .  All that we are and have today is possible because of the foundation that we had before , if we have n't take the risk that our ancestors took every day we would't be here .  And the world it 's going to keep changing and we need to keep changing too , trying new things , taking risks . It 's your option to change or not but if you decided not too take a risk or not to try a new thing ; my friend you will be left behind and with time cease .  In the times we live now adays everybody has to try new things and new risks , learn new things , it is really easy to become obsolete in this world . Even choosing your carrer , let 's say Doctor in surgery . You just finished the university and after a couple of years they discovered a new anesthesia that it 's better for the human body , but you do n't know how to use it and you do n't want to take tha chance of knowing something new , an improvement to your carrer , with time this anesthesia is the only anesthesia available . In what have you become ? ; you have become obsolete because you refused the change . Now it 's not a change anymore is what people are doing and they already know how to do it well , but not you .  Change and taking new risks it 's inherit in our nature , the human will always try new thing and find new risks that 's our nature and that 's why we are on top of the food chain .	SPA
Education is ongoing for our entire life . In addition , it is commonly known that education at school is one of the most important parts of continuous education of life . I am totally agree with the statement that is `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts `` with two reasons .  My first reason comes from the fact that is it is impossible to give all ideas and information at school . That is , because of the limited time , you can not teach every thing to students at school . That 's why , students must be provided to understand ideas and concepts . For example , last year I took a mathematics class and we discuss about theories of a certain subject . There were plenty of theories to study but the class was once per week for a semester . The professor provided us to understand the subject completely , afterwards , we could handle other theories by ourselves .  My second reason is that we educated at school to have some ideas to practise into our life after school . If we understand ideas and concepts at school , we can have a change to apply them into the rest of our life . Hence all information and ideas can be valued to worth our time that is spend at school . To give a specific example , I am a professional female now , and last week I met a realy complex problem at work . A studying at university with my mathematics project helped me surprisingly . Because that time , I really understood the idea in the project . I also felt that I was not regret for the time that I spend at university .  To sum up , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts to give a hand to them for their future . Finally it must the main point for education at school .  t	TUR
Whethere most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a good question . The advertisement is made to increase the selling of the product . So , majour are the qualities of the product that the people know , majour are the selling . Then it can be that some advertising make poduct seem much better .  An example are the figure of food products , in the image on the box they seem very beautifull and also very good to eat . But when you open the box and see the product inside , you understand that the pruduct on the box is very different .  When I was child and I saw the advertisement of a play I would had this play because in the advertisement it moved much , spok a lot and it had beautifull color . But when I took the play it was static , spok only four or five word and it had bad color .  In this case the advertising is used to increase the selling unsing the little child that when they see something that looks like beautifull they want that . There are also some rules that say that the advertisements must respect the quality of the product , but these rules are not always used . To tell the truth there are also some advertisemets that make seem the products as they realy are . But these are not much because if you show in an advertisement a product that is not beautifull the people prefer to buy another product that in the advertisement seem more beautifull than the other , maybe also if it cost much .

I agree with the statement . The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .  People travel in order to enjoy and take a break from our routines . Some people travel for pleasure purpose But the main reason for travelling is to see new places and meet new people . We can not meet new people unless we do not travel in group and as far as seing new places is concerned , we can not know the history of the places without having sumone told it to us . A person who has all the knowledge about the past present and the future of a monument , city or a country . This knowledge is best given to a traveller by tour guide .  Travelling alone does not serve the purpose of travellin itself . We go to new places and want to explore them but we are unable to because we are new to the place and do not know where to go and what to do . A tour guide leeds us to the right places and the tells us things we would never know if it wasnt told to us . Specialy historical monuments . There is a reason behind every historical structure ever made and visiting the structure and not knowing when , why and by who was it made is like seeing the pictures in a book and saying we have read it . Only a tour guide has the knowledge and the communication skills to make the people more familiar to a new place .  We have heard about the saying ` the more the merrier ' , this is the right way to describe a trip taken in a group . When there are others traveling with us we not only get to know them and make new friends but they also add to the whole experience of travelling by sharings their backgrounds , cultures and experiences . The kind of excitement it adds to your trip is worth it . What do people get by tarevlling alone ? Not even half the experiences of the people who travel in a group led by a tour guide . Because they have n't met new people , made new friends , gathered knowledge about the place they have visited .  For a person like me who loves to talk and make friends and learn from my experience of travelling to new places with new people there can not be a better option for travel other than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .	HIN
I agree with the statement because , after all , the purpose of the advertisements is to point out the advantages of a product and this is usually achieved by exagerating them .  One common scenario on TV advertisements is to show happiness situations that are not necessarily related to the product being promoted . For example , you can see a sad person in a gray rainy day whose mood changes to absolute happines as the sun rises automatically when they drink a coke . Even though the weather has nothing to do with people drinking cokes , they try to sell the idea that a refresh drink can make you happy no matter what .  On the other hand , magazine and photograph based advertisements usually tend to use very simple triks such as showing products bigger than they are , or accompanied by a lot of accesories wich are not included , and sometimes not even sold at all , but make the real product look a lot more attractive .  Furthermore , some advertisements show results that can not be completely achieved by the product itself , to convince people to use them . This is very common in diet products , where a very thin model wakes up in the morning to do some exercise but she just goes to the refrigerator and drinks a diet yogurth . Desite of the fact that the yogurth could only prevent you from gaining extra weight , the propaganda makes it look like it actually can make you lose weight .  Finally , another issue is that the advertisements do n't show the dissadvantages of the products or if they do , because of some reglamentation , they do it as fast an ilegible as it is possible . This is the case of alcoholic beverages ' advertisementes , which show a very small and really fast read phrase were they advertise that drinking in excess is not good for your health .  As a conclussion , it can be forseen that advertisements do n't usually say the hole truth about a product and one has to be very carefull in examining the real characteristics of it before buying or using it .

Yes , I agree the Statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . Willing to travel along with a group of people is a good option rather than travelling alone . There were many factors which will benfit us while we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide .  Firstly , by considering the security factor which is a big task in tours especially to forgien countries , we can feel more security while we are along with a group of people rather than alone . Even in case of some tough situations we will get the support of everybody in a group .  Secondly , travelling in a group is economically more recomended than travelling alone . We can share the experiences and joy while we are travelling in a group and we can benfit from most of the expenditures we will face . Many tourism departments in various countries are offering good tourism packages for the people who are coming for forgien tours . They are providing discounts and valid packages especially people travelling in a group rather than travelling alone .  Thirdly , we can have a planned timetable and we can have lot of fun all along the tour along with our group members , we can plan more programmes and events which will entertain us along with our fellow members and even we can had a large . Even imagine if our group consist of various talented persons , the we can organise seminars on research oriented topics in a forgine land .  Lastly apart from the above factors i.e ; security , reducing expenditures , presenting individual talents and joy we get while travelling in a group . We can also plan some industrial tours or join in a training programmes which will enhance our skills in our job and all and travelling in a group will always shows up the identity where ever we tour .

There is a common belief that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . There are people who do not believe that advertisements do not say the truth but the opponents of the subject do not think so . I also agree that advertisements make the products seem better that they really are . Here are three main aspects why advertiements may lie .  First to think about advertisements is their purpose of preparation . Advertisements are designed to convince the consumer to buy or consume that particular product . In order to convince a consumer for a product , one should make him believe that he really needs that particular product or make him believe that the product is best at all . For both of the purposes , the product has to be shown to be the best . This brings us the possibility that advertisements may reflect non-real facts about a prodct .  Secondly advertisements are prepared to increase the profit for the specific product . The producers , who would like to profit more and more , would also agree to display a non-realistic advertisement in order to make the product seem better so that increase the sales . When the sales increase , the profit also increases . In short if the product seems better , its sales increase and this leads to a higher profit for the company .  Finally , the third purpose of an advertisement is to help the company to dominate in the market . Companies have to compete with each other with respect to their products in order to survive in the market . So an advertisement that shows a specific product better that that of another company would make that specific company to win the race among the companies . This again shows that advertisements are not designed to describe a product but rahter make it seem better .  In short , people believe that advertisements make the products seem better thatn they really are , are right to think so . Because advertisments are prepared in the thought of financial profits . A company would not agree to say the truth in the cost of earning less .	TUR
I think that actually it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects ; because in this way a person will have a great knowledge of it 's own campus and will be able to investigate more about it , get deep into it , and dedicate enough time to get a complete management of this subject .  Our world is specialized , everything is divided and classified . Everything is organized and put in a way that every little thing is different to the other . The perfect examaple of this is a carreer in College . The programs are divided into faculties and the careers that a person can pick of , like : Engineering , business , teaching , music , medicine , etc . Every single one of the mentioned before is specialized in a field of studie , and deals with different aspects of knowledge , maths , biology , languages , politics , etc . A world of possibilities .  It is not possible to a human being know all about something ; just a little bit of everything . If a persons dedicates it 's entire life to study astronomy ; investigate , make studies , ask questions , promote projects , etc. , surely will get far and will adquire a huge knowledege in this field . That person will go beyond than someone who studies a little bit of many academic subjects . This takes time and effort , and there is not enough time in a human being 's life to get knowledge in many many different subjects and get as far as if there is specializing in one specific subject .  In the school , the kids get all the basic knowledges they need to start . Then is their decision to go for the subject that they are more interested on . This does not mean that a person has to specialize in one and only one subject and can not know anyhting about anything else . This just means that that person will be more wise in that specific field and will contribute more to society and the world . Specialize in one specific subject is equal to a better and deepest understading of it .	SPA
The way we are educated is influencing a lot what we become later . I think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important . It can be very usefull when one wants to interact with other people . It is essential to share ideas and thougths with others . In the professional life , for instance , if somebody in a company has to work with another department , his task will be much easier if he knows a little bit about the activity of this department . Even if it is not a complete understanding , it will be appreciated by the other part .  To give another exemple , related to personal life this time , it is very agreable to be able to argue or discuss when we meet someone new . Without this broad knowledge , how wolud we make contact , at least at the beginning ? We would obviously miss the oportunity to get in touch with peolpe . I would say that , having a broad knowledge is really a plus in life , it is like the promise to be welcomed and integrated almost wherever we go .  On the other hand , I think we can not only be satisfied with a broad knowledge . We need to go further sometimes . We need to be in something exciting to keep a goal to our life . And this can not be achieved without being specialized in one subject . Again , professionaly speaking , it is essential to be specialized . Nobody can pretend to a job , which is something specific of course , if one does not know enough on this particular topic . That is why we usually start our studies by general education , a broad knowledge , and then , gradualy focus , year after year , on what we want to do .  Plus , I think it is something very valuable for a human being to go in depth of something , to prove to ourselves that we are able to do something special , something that defines us .  To conclude , I would say that both approaches are necessary . We need both to learn things about our environment , about the world , in order to interact , but we need to survive , by saying , `` I can bring you this , I can be helpfull with this '' .	FRE
I disagree with this opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I will raise the reasons in following passages .  First , as one of the japanese , and one citizen of the developed country , I think there are possibilities that the number of the cars in use will be reduced , because particulary in City , the person can transport easily without a car thanks to the sophistication of the network among train , subway , and bus . And I think in the part of suburban also develop the similary methods to transport like City . But what I want to say here is that the opinion I mentioned now is too micro to think globally .  Second , I think we must think more worldwide . In the earth , there are many countries want to be more developed . In these countries , I think that the number of cars in use is increasing . The reason why the developing country will use more cars in future is that , to develop the country economic capacitiy , the needs of cars will increase to transporate many goods to commerese . I think the transporation abilitiy has a significant meanig to these countries .  In conclusion , to think world development , I think disagree with the opinion .	JPN
I definitely agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . I will explain this opinion as follows .  The world is in a great stage of transformation . If people still follow to the same old traditional ways and ideas of the past we will not move further in our life . If Graham Bell did not try out for new things where would have been our communication system . If Wright Brothers did not take risk where would have been out transportation system . It all is about thinking differently , creatively to becone successful .  According to experiments conducted our mind is very creative . It can think about wide variety of things in wide variety of ways . We must not suppress our thoughts to the traditional ideas our ancestors followed and stick back to the rules and regulations . It may be necessary to follow some rules in some cases . But in all cases it is not . This trying out for new things must be cultivated from the childhood itself . Take for example of a maths problem to be solved . A child must think of finding a new way of finding a solution rather than following the solution given by the teacher . This makes the child to better understand the problem and will never forget about it . This makes the child successful and the success is carried throughout the career .  In the initial stages we may be criticized for our ideas but one should not be given up by such critics . We must remember that great people are often criticized . `` Even Einstein was questioned '' . To be successful we need to go on with our ideas and creativity , we need to try out for new things every time , we need to take risk , forget the old traditional ways of doing things but not to care about the criticism . We should challenge the critics .  Success involves a lot amount of risk when we are trying out for new things . Nothing can be easlily obtained . We should never be afraid of the amount of the risk invovled but should always head towards the success after the risk . The success involving a risk gives us great pleasure than success without involving risk . '' The fruit gained from a great risk is more tasty '' .  Its proved in past and also it will be proved thereafter that trying new things , thinking differently and creatively , taking risk brings a great success . In this way i support my statement .	TEL
I precisely agree to this statement . People seldome does not happen to challenge new things sicnce they are afraid that they are going to fail on that task , in other words , they are unwilling to challenge new things because they are uncertain and do n't think that they would success . However , in my opinion , I think what is significant is that you actually attempt on doing something even if you fail . I even think that failing is more important than not attempting to try .  Only doing what they already know is not going to make you improve more . It would make you confident in only one thing . For instance , if you a person is trying and trying to do on something as much as he can but he is unsuccessful , he would be successful sooner because he would realize the reason why he failed on this task . In fact , if you attempt to do something however you fail on it few times , its the leading road to success .  For the person who only does what he already know , he will not improve at all but a confidence . Even if this person really knows what he has to do and how to do a thing well , he wo n't be as good as the person who fails and had failed many times . The chance will only come to you if you would start doing and try doing new things . The more doors you open , the more chance to have more opportunities . If you keep the door closed , nothing would come to you . Chance would come only if you open the door .  People wants to success , and wants to have more chances . However , in order to do that , you need to make opportunitie by yourself . It seems difficult and it is , however you just have to open the door and you will see a road where fail leading to success .	JPN
I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today . As cars mainly depends on fuels that are conventional , there resouses are limited . This might increase the demand for the petroleum and there products . After some years or due to continues increase in fuel costs may forces people to move away from the cars and they mostly depend on public transport which is quite economical and has several advantages .  Governament will implement different plans to discouage people to use cars by lavying heavy taxes on regestration , insurance charges , road taxes & yearly reneveal charges . which makes not affordable for the people to own a car .  Due to continues decrease in petroleum resourses , the auto manufacturing companies are focussing on non-conventional sourses like Electric car , Hybrid car . As electric car is limited for certain distance and it requires to charge than for some time to make it run again which is a major drawback .  A hybrid car works on uses more than one fuel to run , which is quite costly but it is stated as a future car . In future , we may see only these cars running on roads .  Due to increase in population the number of car user increases which will increase the emmissions of gases like co2 , lead particles into the air . This will damage our environment and hazardious to health . Because these gases may cause lung cancer , respiration problems .  so , it is the responsibility of governament to encourage people use more public transport which makes less depend on petroleum , environmental friendly , less crowding the roads and economical also .

For lots of people , traveling is one of the most enjoyable experiences . Throughout the world , millions of tourists travel every year . Some of those tourists travel independantly while others are led by tour guides .  In my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid because by this way I will be sure that I will visit the most interisting places at the country to which I traveled . I remember , for instance , my first trip to Egypt and how the tour guide insured me and the other group members seenig the most fascinating archaeological sights there . Moreover , I believe that being led by a tour guid is more secure than exploring a foriegn country lonely . However , being led by a tour guide would not be a happy experience for a tourist who wants to wonder around the real cities and discover the the other lively sides of a country .  Furthermore , there are other methods that can provide the same capablity of a tourist guid . For example , the books that include useful information about the places that can be enjoyable for tourist to visit , maps and illustrated books .  Another important raeson makes me prefer traveling with a group that being with a group of someone 's country or cluture would make them feel more secure and safe rather than knowing no one .  In conclusion , I would prefer to guided by a local person who know more than me about his/her country .	ARA
I would have to agree by the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .  As more and more cars are rapidly produced today , the government especially has been doing all its best to provide necessary public transportations throughout a nation . The space allocated for the vehicles will soon be not enough . Population growths directly contributes to the increase in the number of drivers on the road . Highways of hundred of metres tall will anyway be fully congested with drivers . With limited spaces or lands throughout a country , any single government would surely take the step into reducing the number of cars on road , which also could cause pollutions .  As do the government here in Malaysia , they are trying their best to reduce the number of cars on the road . One move that was made to the Malaysian government on to reduce the number of cars is by imposing taxes . By imposing heavy percentage of taxes on imported as welllas the local cars , it was believed to be an incentive for drivers to find an alternative mode of transport . But this has obviously been proved less effective . This automatically brought them about to reducing the number of drivers instead . For example of an action that has taken by the government is by setting an older age line for wannabe drivers to be competant on the road .  This delay of upcoming drivers is also supported by another wise move which like any other country , which is by improving the country 's public transportation . Public transportation is the one and only solution that can help curb future congestions on the road . Take for example , the train . Easy accessibility , low and flat priced ticket and large-sized public transportation is the perfect charactheristic of a highly effective mode of vehicle which many government are vying to achieve . The most obvious example of a highly effective public transport is none other than the bullet train located in Japan . Another example is the country , Australia that I have visited . The sight of seeing only small number of cars in the roads of Australia has clearly shown to me , as a Malaysian what my country should ought to be like . If in Austrialia , every now and then you can only hear a honk or the screeches of the tyres , I 'm sure in twenty years down the road the roadway will be an empty one !  Thx , Sign	CHI
At first glance , we may think that speacilazing in one subject is good for us as we can concentrate all our time and energy on just one subject . But having this kind of strategy might prevent us from to complete our necessary improvement .  Firstly , all kinds of sciences have complex structures that no specific subject can be thought to be completely independent from other academic subjects . Having no knowledge about other academic subjects is something that will always limit us during our studies . For instance , a computer scientist like me may never need information about sciences like physics or chemistry during university studies . But if on one day , I need to create a software for a company that produce chemical products , I will need asistance from other people for everything that is related to chemistry . From the projects I have made for the industry , I realized that having some knowledge about every topic really helps . In fact , a computer engineer can not be seen as a real engineer , if he does not even have basic concepts of general engineering principles . He will always will be incomplete and in need of help from other people .  In addition , as far as I learned from the software industry , having broad knowledge of many subjects is something that seperates you from other people in the same area and makes you chosen instead of others . If we really want to be good in our jobs , this can not be succeeded by just concentrating on one subject .  Another fact is that there are so many interesting academic subjects in the science . We may be happy if we can have spend some time on some other subject and improve ourselves . It is not a good thing to limit ourselves to just one subject all the time as there might be lots of topics that might be interesting for us .  In conclusion , I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . As we have time and resources to get knowledge about many academic subjects during our university studies , we should try to get familiar with the highest number of academic subjects and we should not limit ourselves to just one top .

Although many people prefer to continue doing the usual jobs that they are professional in , I prefer to try new things and take the risks to try . I bilieve that the most sucessful people in this world have overcome the idea of continuing to do the usual job again and again . That 's why they became unique between the others . some reaosn for why I dont ' like the usual work I already know is that it limits my thinking . Innovation is a very important skill in my career and our company is spending around $ 10000 a year as an award for the best innovations . Examples are many which I will adress some of them next .  The richest man in this world Bill Gates . If this man has remained doing the same job his ceolleges used to do everyday , he would not gain all this mony over the last 20 years . Bill gates was working in one of the software companies . He Has tried to deveope a small program into a small operating system . He succeded and this was a big jump in the world of information technology . The operating system was developed into a further smarter one that could manage many tasks the computer operator used to do consuming a lot of time . Recently , he has released all those versions of windows and profit billions of money . I bilieve that he was a very sucessful man and this was because he tried to invent .  Another exmple from my own life is when I stopped by my supervisor door and said `` look we have discontinue doing the same paper work everyday and get ready for the new challenge ! '' . I explained to him my idea which emplies automating the payment authorization form in our company . This form was processed manually and get around 10,000 forms every month from the same type . I supervized the project of automating the form to be an electronic one . I were able to complete with all the appreciation and support from our higher manageemnt and I have saved around $ 40 , 0000 to my company . Finally , I were promoted and that was all because of my new idea .  Now , I am teaching my brothers and sisters on how to be innovative . I bilieve that life without innovation is a dead one .	ARA
I think that it is a common opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do . In my opinion this is not so far from the real situation , but it can depends on what you mean with enjoy . There many different aspects in this statement so I think that it is difficult to give a unique and clear opinion .  For instance , if you like play football you will not probably enjoy yourself if you are an old man . A young boy is more powerfull and he can play for a long period of time , while an old man will probably lose his energy in few minutes , not so much time for a good and amusing match .  On the opposite , if you like to play your guitar , your age will not be a real problem . Even if you are ten years old or seventy years old you can enjoy yourself as you want .  Maybe we can say that a young boy may have less problematic thought than an older person , so his innocence can let him the possibility of enjoying much more his life .  For example an adult man has many more things to do than his son . He may have no free time so the young child can do anything he want to enjoy himself , while his father has a life full of problems , so he can not enjoy as his child .  There is an another aspect in this discussion that is of relevant imporatance . Older people are often more rich than young people are . So they can do anything they want , because they have much more money . For example if you are a twenty years old boy and you like yacthing you may have some problem to buy one yacht . Maybe you will buy it in your adulthood .  At the end I think that the foundamental aspect of the topic is the possibility to be sick when you became an old man . This is a big problem and makes me think that if you are a young person you will enjoy much more your life .	ITA
Some people believe that young people enjoy life more than older people , but from the daily life point of view I think that also older people can enjoy life in many ways .  In this modern society , cities , towns , and also little countries offer to all aged persons right ways to enjoy life . Young peolple can meet eachothers in disco clubs , pubs , cafes and spend their time toghether . The same things can be done also by alder persons , if the healt is good .  Maybe , in my opinion , young people can enjoy life with more sports than older persons . Young people have a youg body with many energies to spend . They have resistance and a young heart full of energie .  But older people have , however , many others valid ways to enjoy life . They can spend time in the park of the cities , they can feed animals in the zoo , thay can play cards toghether , they can play some instrument , like guitar or piano . All those opportunities however product smiles and older people feel relax .  Another important thing to substain my opinion is that older people have the power of the experince of their past life . This is an important force for their soul . Memories of the past bring them to fell strong emotions , maybe romantic emotions .  At this point , is very hard for me to come a conclusion . I 'm a young boy with many wishes , and those wishes are also a strange way to enjoy life . I spend a little of my free time imaging , imaging and dreaming the future . This produces in me emotions . Maybe I 'll use these emotions one day in the future .	ITA
With the development of our country 's economic . Travelling becomes a new fashion of spending the time of holiday . Now there is a heated concerning over whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Some people think travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best choice . From their point of views , the guide will give you a plan and arrange your travelling route . Well , this might be good , if the place you want to go is in the plan of the tour guide . However , as far as I am concerned , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice . I prefer travelling alone .  First and foremost , trave by oneself can do whatever you want to . You can go on the internet , search the place you admire , learn more knowledge about it , find the way to it . The following thing is to find some time , pick up your bag , take some food , go directly to the place you want . You do not need to go to the place you are not interested in or you have ever been to .  Equally important is that the time for travelling by oneself is flexible . You can do travelling by any time in any season . If you appreciate some places of interests , just stay a little long , look around more about it . It does no matter with others . While in a group , you have to respect the opinion of others ' .  In the end , another point that we should not forget is that some tour guiders will take travellers to some place that people do not want to . Guiders may take travellers to some local markets where the price are very high . Meanwhile , the goods are inferior .  All in all , I disagree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Travelling by one 's own wiil much happier .	CHI
In my personal experience , I 've noticed that having a better knowledge of one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of a number of academic subjects . At the University I attended different courses referring to three main areas : History , Law and Economics . After my graduation I can say that I had a good knowledge of a series of academic subjects , but I realized that this was not so good for those who are searching a job , in particular the first job experience . In fact , like all my friends did after graduation , I began to search for a job .  In trying to find something adequate to my generalistic preparation , I 've understood that it is difficult for people who do n't have a specialization to find a job , in particular a qualified job .  Talking with some friends coming from Economic studies , they all told me that the labour market has notably changed in recent years . These changes took place since a strict division of work had become a necessity for companies and factories , for example . Consequently , it could be noticed that who offers a job is generally looking for qualified candidates , for people who have a high knowledge of a particular topic or , in better words , who is specialized in a specific subject .  I have found that this is true , because all my friends who obtained a PhD or attended technical faculties have found a job in just a few months , while others with a more generalistic knowledge or university degree are still searching for a job .  In conclusion I agree with those who prefer to specialize in a specific subject , because I think that in doing so , they could have more chances to find a job .	ITA
I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I belive that a lack of altruistic and selfless acts are directly spurred from economic and social reasons .  In today 's world , many youths do not see a valid social reason to immerse themselves in community service . Although the majority of the world 's population lives in abject poverty , those who are capable of giving to their communities are often segregated from those who are in need . Hence , the lack of awareness prevents today 's youth from helping out .  Speaking from personal experience , I find that there is a gradual decline in my own community of youths that refuse to give or help out their communities in any manner . As the president of Key Club , an international community service organization in my high school , I find it more and more difficult every year to recruit new members to replace the ones that have departed . I remember when there were about 40 members in the group - now I find that it is even difficult to gather 20 members for the meetings . The only sense of giving that can be felt in my school 's atmosphere is purely caused from the need to `` look good '' on transcripts for college . Of course , I 'm sure not all of them feel this way , but I truly think it 's safe to say that the majority feels this way .  Every year , monetary donations rise in Key Club as the number of members decline . This is an economic reason why I belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . Inevitably , most of us in the world have been brought up be capitalists - when we give , we expect something back in return . However , when youths help out with their communities , they do not receive something tangible as rewards . Hence , today 's youth neglects to help their communities . Due to this fact , those who can help and give find it extremely annoying to invest their time in helping others . Thus , their only token of help is through monetary means , which they believe is compensation for not giving time to their communities . Nonetheless , society 's greed can even prevent the giving of money .  It 's truly a shame to look around and see that today 's youth , or tomorrow 's leaders , refuse to invest their time when they are perfectly capable of doing so . It is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their times for others . Once youths overcome their laziness , fear of helping out , and learn that the greatest reward ( as cliched as it may sound ) is the fuzzy feeling they get from giving time and helping others , it will be the massive stepping stone in getting the world 's youth more involved .

I firmly believe that young people do enjoy life more than older people . As they are young and healthy they can do such things which older people could only imagine for their days of youth which have already passed .  For instance an older person can not participate in an adventure spoort . They can only sit back and relax while watching younger people do it . With their back pain and long list of medicine to take its even hard to imagine it . Even if they have a heart to do it and brains to work for it even then they are unable to do it as their body dose not respond to these lofty thoughts .  Its easier for younger people to adopt new things but it is quite difficult for old people to do the same . As a person matures in life even his thought processes change . He gets more into the guiding thing than doing it actually and in that also generally people dont like guidance they want to learn it on their own by experimenting with it . This further leads to the cut off of elder people from the younger onces . When you dont have much people around life can not be enjoyable .  Ever wondered why all the players , workers , etc retire after a certain age . Its because of their reducing ability and diminishing spirit . An old person has to give way to a younger one no matter whether he likes it or not . Imagine life as a coach of a team shouting order at the team players and thinking of the days when he himself ruled the field . He is their not because he wasnt good but because he can not do it any more .  To some extent this can be explained biologically as well . At older age your senses begin to diminish and these are the only source of communication with the outer world . In such a condition how can you expect a person to enjoy more . With age body begins to wear down and healing process starts taking longer time . Older people can not enjoy anything to its limit .  Everyone must have heard his or her parents or grand parents saying - `` Those were the best days of my life . '' A broad grin comes on their face when you talk to them about the days when they were young . You can not expect a bigger proof than this when they are themselves admitting it .  So it can be concluded without doubt that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .	HIN
For my part I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . This goes back to a varity of reasons . Primarily cars today are indispensible to go to work for a lot of people . Secondary cars are more than that , their use is comfortable . What also matters a lot is the lack of an alternative . And there are no factors prospected , which could chance the need of cars during the next twenty years .  First of all cars are neccessary for many people to reach their place of work . Both of my parents can only get to work by car since the ways are to individual and partly to wide to make use of public transportion .  If you consider big citys , you can not always make use of public transportion . Especially in smaller citys , where public transportion may only exist in small or even does not exist at all and taking a bike is not possible either , you really need a car .  Furthermore I can not see any reason , why this state of being should change during the next twenty years .  There will be no doubt . Having a car to get from one place to another is - with few exceptions - the fastes and therefore most comfortable way . Since people desire gaining all amenties possible thez supposedly will not give them up voluntarily .  Everyone , who ones had the comfort of owing a cars appreciates it . So I can so no reason in the future whz this would chance , either .  Lastly we lack an alternative . There is no more convienient way to travel and there are so many jobs in the car business . In decrease in consume would help to kill manz thousand jobs . Worldwide car producing industries hold so manz jobs . Their falling apart would be fatal . Furthermore the world inhabits a very strong lobby concerning the oil business , which will be interested in a further need and consumption of their oil .  Here another job giving area exist that manz people depend on . I can not see that the influence politicians might chance that .  Still a lot of cars are sold and , in my opinion will be sold . World population does decrease in the industrial states slightly , but it will not have the effect , that less cars will be in use in twenty years .  Considering the facts it may be a good thing , if there were fewer cars for this would help our environment get healthier again . Even so the need and lacking alternatives will not chance the amount of cars during the next twenty years .	GER
How many young people do commit time to helping their communities at all ? Judging from my personal experience I would say not many . I know maybe two people how do community work on a regluar basis . Now maybe that is just fine . Maybe young people are not supposed to give a helping hand to their communities and should focus on their education or on having un instead ? I would like to argue that this is not the case , that there are many benefits in young people doing community work and thus that young people ought to invest more of their time in these activities .  Obviously there are many direct benefits for the communities . If many young people are engaged in helping the elderly , giving free tuition to younger school kids , clearing public places from rubbish the community can save on these activities and put the money to some other beneficial use .  Moreover the communities gain indirectly from stronger youth participation . Accomplishing meaningful tasks together with their peers will keep many young people from doing things that would do damage to their communities . Think about petty crimes and vandalism .  Finally it is not only the community as a whole that benefits , but there is also something in for the young people who engage in community work . I may not have appreciated it from the very beginning but after a while of doing community service I realized how talking to and helping elderly and disabled people made me see the world with different eyes . I strongly felt that I benefited from the wealth of experince that I found in an old man who had lived through two world wars or in the different approach a blind teenage boy took to issues like love and dating . And after all in doing community work you make a lot of	GER
I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  For one example , when you think about business , a company has to make new products or explore new techiniqe to make difference from other companies . If the company can do this , it can apeal cutomer the difference of there producuts or sevices from other 's and it can profit itself monopolicaly .  For other example , when you think about a baseball team , every player shoud try new things , because we do n't need same player so much . It makes no sence to have nine powerful hitter . It makes nosence to have fast runner . To consitute a strong team , the important point is the balance that can infer best outcome . So every player have to get skill that are diferrent from other 's and new .  For last example , if you are an investor , it makes no sence to invest like others . Iif you want to have an advantage , you hav to invest differently . Ofcause I have to admit it is a risky action . You may get a loss sometime . So you have to recognize that there is a risk in investing differently from others .  From these reasons , I conclude that as long as recognizing the risk of an action , we have to try new things and teke risks .	JPN
I agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Here are my reasons :  More and more people concern about the polluted problem of environment , and not only government decides to pass bills that can protect our nature environment , but also people reduce the damage to our environment . And cars are one of vital damage to these pollution , because they release carbon dioxide . If people reduce to drive cars by themselves , instead , use the mass transportation , the amount of carbon dioxide , which is a vital reseason that cause pollutions can be eliminated . So I think cars will be fewer than today .  Second , cities are developed grauatedly , more and more cities will have their mass transportation , such as MRT , trains , or buses . These useful development can provide a more ecnomical way to transport for citizens . In order to save money and priceless time , people will choose to use mass transportation rather than drive cars by themselves . For example , although many teachers of mine have their own cars , but they only drive cars by themselves in rainy days . Because the MRT in our city provides a cheaper and comfortable journey for us . And they do n't need to drive .  In addition , the expenditure to maintain a car is very big . For example , the expenditure of gasoline , the tax of cars , etc . This huge expenditure would effect the willing of people having a car .  Finally , crowed traffic situation would also make people do not want drive car by themselves . And there is still a big problem to drivers : finding a parking space is extremely hard .  To sum up , the idea of environmental protection , more conveinent mass transportation , the expenditure of having a car , to avoid stuck in a traffic jam , worry about how to find a parking space on time , all of these considerations would make fewer and fewer people to plan to have their own cars .

I have always considered travelling as excellent method to know many people and to know many different cultures . But it could be a little bite expensive and dangerous if you do not have the apropriate instruction . In this paper I want to disscuss about the advantages and disadvantages that we could appear when we are travelling with out a suitable orientation .  First at all , If we are travelling in a group led by a tour quide , we can feel safer and more confident to explore new things and landscapes . It is due to the expertise and experience that a tour guide could have . Moreover , the guide could show to the travellers the important and interesting places that the group should visit during the trip . It is too important because it can be saved money and time . ! you go straight to the point . It is fantastic .  On the other hand , if we travel in group led by a tour guide we can feel uncomfortable with many things . One of them is that you can not visit some places when you want do it because it is usually that a tour guide has a travelling route decided and scheduled before the trip has started . Adding this point , you can not enjoy isoleted spaces and activities because most of the time you have to share different activities with tthe all group and it can be boring experience .  From my point of view it is very important to travel with someone else , but if I have the opportunity to do it in group it is wonderful . Because of the mutual cultural and interpersonal exchange . Youcan enjoy and involve in many activities easily . But if you group has a tour guide is excelent tool to know a a lot of places using less time and money . I think the most important issue if you want to travel is to be prepared to do it alone , in a group or with a tour guide . It doesn not matter , jus take into account your happiness and your feeling to have fun .	SPA
Nowadays , there are evolving interesting discussions pertaining to whether young people do give enough time to help their communities or not . In this connection , and based upon my experience as undergraduate and graduate student at The American University in Cairo ( AUC ) , I would state that it is my belief that young people are actually devoting enough time to develop and make life better in their small and large communities .  First , I would provide express examples of how AUCians have invested efforts to support their small living community , that is AUC . In this regard , it is worth noting that prior to start of the new academic year , AUCians usually gather in organized groups that tend to make orientation to the new freshmans . Usually , there are groups that cover wide spectrum of services that include orientation to the AUC campus including classes , labs , library , and departments . Also , these groups introduce the new students to the university catalogue and related matters such as advising , course registeration , and requirements for joining any specific major . Moreover , the same groups make the new students familiar with the various extra corricular activities that are available on campus . Another aspect of devotion of young AUCians are devoted to their small community is that they join certain groups that target alumni and other sponsors in order to provide adequate funding for many of the activities that are arranged at AUC . In this way , it is evident that how the young AUCians prove to be effective in serving their small community .  On the other hand , and as far as AUCians services for their large community are concerned , it will be essential to highlight the role of the different clubs at AUC . AUC hosts many clubs that are fully operated through young students and aim at making life better in Egypt . There are many clubs that include , inter alia , help club , cancer club , and hand in hand club . The help club is a club that aims at providing the poor people in Egypt with better living conditions . This is attained via gathering donations from AUC young students and using the same to buy food , clothes , homes , and shelter for the poor people . Furthermore , the cancer club concentrates its efforts on collecting donations to support patients of cancer in their tough struggle with this severe disease . Along the same line , the hand in hand club aims at visiting elder people who are hosted in various elder houses . During these visits members of the hand in hand club tend to provide the said elders with their needs and try to draw a smile on their faces as a simple reciprocation for the sincere efforts in their youth . Accordingly , it goes beyound doubt that the young students at AUC play a vital role in serving their large community .  In light of the above , and based on life examples of the young students at AUC , it can be concluded that young students have feel their belonging beleonging to their societies . Thus , they have enthusiasm and dedication to help and serve their communities .	ARA
In twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use thanking to the technologycal progress . If in the past centuries technologycal progress was often linked to negative consequences like deep industrialization and exploitation of the naural resources , in the more recent years the idea of a technologycal progress that can get along with nature or even help nature spread both in the scientific world and public opinion .  That is why modern scientist are looking for a kind of car who does not pollute the air , working on a project about a car engine that does not use petrol but something alternative .  This alternative power could be hydrogen , and rumour has it that scientist already invented it but it can not be solt because of market reasons . Moreover , public transportation is getting cheaper and cheaper , so that in the future most of people will use it . People in the future will be much more interested in enviromental problems , just like we are more respectful towars nature than our ancestors . It said , in fact , that in the past cities were more noisy and polluted than nowadays , and some ancient authors wrote that when Rome was the capital of the Roman Empire it was almost impossible to fall asleep in the city even at night , and that the noise was unbearable .  Governments , especially in the western world , started to feel the problems connected to the uncontrolled use of cars , and they will probably vote some politics to make the people prefer not polluting engines or other kind of transports .  Also , since they learnt the lesson from their own past , western governments will teach the countries which are now getting industrialized new ways to produce and get richer with no deep exploiting of the land that may cause natural disasters like it happened in the recent years in some areas of the world .

Whenever we are discussing about the study , one thing we should always take into the consideration is that there should not be any conflict , on the matter In my point of veiw person 's academic backgruond make that person more strong in his future so as in the student life they should never deni or refuse for the further education , because it may give them somewhere less status int he society which might in future lead him in the depression .  In my opionion , i feel it is alway better to have specialize in one subject than having only the broad knowledge of the many academic subjects , Because l feel lots may things might make student puzzle as dont have the enough complete knowledge of any subject , but if a student is Master in a subject he can definately make a successful life he will definately have the all detail information of the subject and no one will challenge him at any point of his subject and he can do much progress in his carriar  Not only in the knowlege but Economically also that student became more confident , independent and able carry his life with all leisure , and he will grow up in his life . Many other professional will promote him and as his experience will keep him onthe highest peak of sucess , and satisfaction , his income , respect , and the position where he is working will definaltely keep on increase .  And , all these things finally relax him in the end of his life , he will have the satisfaction about the professional victory he has gain in his life , Every specialisation will differ each one from the other and he or she became a specific knowledegable person and will gain all the importance in himself .  Finally , i want to conclude BE SPECIALIZE WITH A SPECIFIC SUBJECT it will complete circle of education .	HIN
With the television and the others mass media in the last 50 's years we had seen a development of the advertisement . The advertisement is used to improve the market of a good , but in a fair market the advertisement can not be false , the adrevrtisement has to show the good in a realistic way .  It is troue tought that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but the point is that the product is the same but there is under , uncovered , a communication game that can change the perception of the peaple , sametimes is a music , sametimes the combination of the colors , other time the situation that is rappresented . So , the point is not the quality of the product , but how you feel when you have that product .  I think that customers have to know that advertisements sametime change the real importance of a product , that there is a psicologically game under the advertisement . Is important understand how the information is real and what is fair in the market and if is fair that advertisement make products seem much better than they really are . The most important example i think is the cigarettes advertisement , this can show us how a bad good , nocive for our healty , is trasmetted like a good product . I think that everybady should think before buy something .	ITA
The life is very beautiful if you know the way that you can enjoy for it . Every one should enjoy in this life befor he/she die . I agree that young people enjoy the life more than older people do because they are healthy , they have a lot of time , and they likes to go out always even they are busy .  The young people are healthy than the older people . The people when they go out they only see young people play outside and they are enjoying when they play . For example , everyday I go outside with my friends to play football and other games if we do not have a lot of works to do for school .  The older people are always busy with their works so they do not have a lot of time to enjoy in this life like a younger people . The older people they have to put time for enjoying . Always I ask my father to put time for us to have fun and go out to enjoy but he always say yes but he did not do it until now .  The older people when they busy they do not take a break for them to have a rest , but the younger people they give themself time when they feel angry or tired . For example , I give my self time when I am tired but my father not and I asked him why but he did not give me an answer .  In short , everyone are younger will enjoy the life more than older people . In my opinion , everyon have to enjoy in their life every moment .	ARA
In my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because of the nature of knowledge such as plentiness and complexity .  Since the 17th century , many inventions were made . Information used to make these inventions and information provided by these inventions are accumulating such that noone alone can know all of these information . For example , in a typical university there are principal department such as natural science faculty , literature faculty , social science faculty etc . . All of these departments have also subdepartments . In my university , for instance , business administration , aconomics , international trade are subdepartments of social sciences faculty . A person can only attend only one of these subdepartments such that it is impossible to finish all of these departmens at the same time . So having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects are not that much possible .  Another reason is the complexity of knowledge in any specific subject . When you want to cure an illness for example to cure the illness AIDS , you should specilize on viruses which are the cause of AIDS . Knowing many academic subjects such as optic , pschology , literature will not make any use to cure AIDS . Since you can only learn by doing it , specializing is better .  Consequently , specializing is better than broad knowledge .	TUR
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . I completely agree with the statement above . Albert Einstein quotes , `` Try to be a man of value and not a man of success . '' Success follows people who are innovative in their ideas and are expressive to present them freely . Albert Einstein never set out to come up with the `` Theory of relativity '' . It was his desire to explore and question every aspect of everyday life which brought him the fame to be the inventor of `` Theory of relativity '' .  Constant change is the human nature . And the people who bring about this change in an evident manner are the ones who are ready to think out-of-the-box . Centuries ago , everything was done on paper , stories to accounts , medicine to religion etc . Today , everything is written on tape drives and stored electronically . Thanks to mankind , who was constantly looking for options to change . We went from pen to typewriter and then to computer and to super computers today . The numerous inventions made in every field of life are all because some one somewhere was thinking beyond the ways which they know how to do well . It was the quest to do things better and add value to what is being done today , which led to new discoveries .  Take an example of Bill Gates , he is successful today because he started Microsoft , a Windows operating System which sits in almost every household today . His desire to do something new brought him this fame . And his quest to constantly bring about the change to the world is keeping his success intact .  In summary , it is seen all around , people who have taken the risk to do something new are the ones who got success and fame .	HIN
I do not believe that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Many factors contribute to my belief . These factors include the current state of driving , current drivers and development in the area of driving . Through this investigation , it will be shown why I disagree with the statement .  The current state of driving today , is one that has morphed several times , to reach where it is at . Before cars ever existed , people found other ways of transport such as boats and horses . The general aim was to be transported or transport items from place to place . The first car that was produced , revolutionized the transportation system . People became more time efficient in reaching where they want to arrive at . Technological advances are made everyday , so as cars started to become faster , people started to lose sight of the purpose of a car . Now faster cars constitute faster drivers . People now place more importance on the pleasure of speeding and performing stunts , rather than getting to where they need to be . This state of driving has an effect on the drivers .  Today , we find that more adolescents are interested in cars than before . As young adults , they enjoy extremes and risks , and the young age at which they are granted a license does not help . Most accidents in my country of Bahrain are attributed to speeding of young people , and the fact that the mortality rate increases each year , seems to have no effect whatsoever . Now , for a driver seeking an adrenalin rush and a living on the edge attitute , the right technology has to be developed .  As I mentioned before , cars today are faster and technologically better than before . We should acknowledge that advancements will not cease , and if we take other life factors into consideration , we see that cars are demanded and are needed even more . As job requirements relating to cars change , so do car expectations . New roads are always being built and so faster , more reliable cars need to be engineered according to the newly built roads .  No matter what is done to reduce car usage , such as increasing the age requirement , or investment in other modes of transportation , I believe that people can not give up on cars due to the privacy and efficiency it provides . Logically speaking , if the world progresses we go forward , not backward , and so in conclusion , forward to me means more cars and not less .	ARA
I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Unfortunatly , I sometimes hear that elder people are bored in their daily life . There are some reasons why I think young people enjoy life more tahn older people do .  First , young people have a lot of energy to move their bodies . Some of them enjoyed suports , travering , and working . They can do many activities . Even though they are tired , they sometimes continue moving without enough rest . If they sleep well , they will be fine the next day .  Furthermore , many of them do not have serious health problems . Many elder people have something health problem , even though they are healthy life . Because they have been older , it is natural thing . Many young people do not have health problems which elder people has .  In addition , the life styles between young people and elder people are different . When I visited a retirement home , an activety director said , if I could come there as much as I could , it would be helpful for them to escape from boring time . They usually stay in the home because it is hard for them to go out by themselves . Therefore , if they do not have any outside activities , they spend their time on a sofa to watch TV . However , young people can go anywhere and anytime by themselves . They can choose how they act on their daily life , but for elder people , they can not have the kind of choice .  These reasons show young people tend to enjoy their life more than elder people do . Young peple have some benefits to enjoy their life more than elder people , so they should enjoy their life . If young people provide enjoyable life for elder people , the elder people have more enjoyable life than they used to have .	JPN
Nowadays people are living in a mixed world with all kind of generations and where the community grows faster . How help yours communauties with the time you have ??? Fisrt of all , in my opinion , I am a student of twenty years old , and I would say that in your evderydaylife , you never find anought time for all you wanted to do .  As far as I am concerned , I would say that giving time for other people , or be investigated in an activity requieres to you a lot of human qualityand a strong engagement .  It might not be easy to help our communauty when you have responsibilty at work , at home , with children . In order to manage a good way of living we have to make choice at any time during our own life .  Secondly , we can considerate the problem with a different point of view . If you are living in a huge town it will be more difficult to help communauty than living in the country .  Thank to there small village in the country , everybody knows everybody . The fact of the densification of the popuation , it 's easier and faster to make link and create central meeting . Obviously , the communauty will grow up with helpful younger .  I do n't really agree with the fact that young people do not give enough time to the communauty . For example , sometimes in your jobs , the director asks to you hight resposabillities , even if you did'nt choice you have to control and help your company . But what we forget it is the fact that it it probably for the biologic research , and htne the communauty progress .  To believe that young peolple are not enought helpful with the communauty will be wrong , their behavior is different . They stay investigated in this huge world .	FRE
Some people might say that its better to a ` Master of one than being a Jack of All ' . But in my personal opinion , its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one . Life is made up of not just thing , but a variety of things and subjects . It is important for any individual to know atleast the basics of almost all , if not all , subjects . Life is integrated with various issues .  The main reason for me to support that experience and knowledge is needed in various aspects of life is to survive in this constant-changing world . World can take up any turn in any time of life . It is hard to predict the twists in the market . Market in one field can drop down suddenly one day , and all businesses in that field will close . So its better to have knowledge of other fields , atleast the preliminary knowledge and skills so that the person can think of starting up of new business if one does n't work .  Second point is recreation . If a person knows few more things to do life other than his regular routine work , it will be like a change for him , which he can enjoy and have fun . You get to know more people around you when to interact , and will help to build relationships between them .  Its a part of our duty to maintain a balance of everything in life . Let us consider one example , currently its the trend of computers and technology , and many people will only take up subjects in Computer science and neglect other aspects like Ecology , Sociology and Economics . Who should care for the betterment and preservation of nature and nation , if no person is knowlegeable about the least the basics of ecology . Everyone should be aware of things taking place in and around his place , his society and nation as a whole .  General knowledge is required to be successfull in life . Every business tycoon in this country has a varied fields of experience and knowledge . If we consider the owner of McDonald 's , who is not just a hotelier but a realtor too . Only because of this , he is able to start up millions of McDonald 's centers in every busy commercial corner of the World . He integrated his knowledge of marketing and real-estates into the knowledge of food-industry .  Thus to conclude , in my views I feel that to lead an independent and successful life , its necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and strongly agree with the statement .	HIN
I would like to disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people and would present arguments against the topic .  First of all we need to clearly define the words - '' enjoying life '' . A lot of us misconstrue the real meaning of these words . True enjoyment means something done to bring joy and happiness to oneself or loved ones and not as a public demonstration effect . This is especially true for older people . After having experienced life and gone through different stages during their life time , older people are much more experienced and mature in their outlook . Therefore they would seldom indulge in activities which are popularly seen as being part of enjoying life . Young people on the other hand , due to a variety of reasons which can include peer pressure , need to experiment , energy , enthusiasm etc. are often seen indulging in the more demonstrable form of activities which can classify under the broad term - enjoying life . So while older people might not go out as often for travelling or adventure trips or movies or partying , they have their own set of activities like book reading , gardening , religious activities , community events etc. to complete a happy and enjoyable day .  I also believe that while at a young age people often enjoy themselves by indulging in self driven activities , at an older age human beings get more happines , satisfaction and enjoyment by doing things for their close and loved ones . For example a father who invests days and nights to build a house so that he and his family can have a secure shelter for a lifetime gets an equal amount of satisfaction and happiness as does a young adventure trekker . This gesture should not be miscontrued as evidence of not enjoying life .  Therefore in conclusion I would like to state that enjoyment is not dependent on one 's age . It is a state of mind which all human beings strive to achieve through various methods and activites during the different stages in their life cycle .	HIN
I think the best way to travel is by alone , not in a group led by tour guide . In my country , there are a lot of tour agencies to different countries . However , traveling should definetly alone because there is not much time the guide gives , traveling alone is more flexible to control time and place to go , and tour information they five can be found indivisual .  In my personal experience , tour guide gives not enough time to see something in one site . For example , I once had a travel to Northeastern United States . I went to New york first . one amazing place was Broadway . Those musical posters , commercials , and stores attracted me . However , the guide gave me only one hour . I wanted to visit the stores and see a musical , but in one hour , all I could do was take photoes and buy a suvenier . If someone is going to travel , He must have flexible time to stay and do something they want to do . Musical , cup of cofee or shopping is their choice .  If people travel alone or by their personal group , they are more flexible in time and deciding where to go . When I was in Cuba , I wanted to go to the beach , but the day , it was rainy , so I changed my plan to stay indoor . and at evening I enjoyed dinner on cool temperature beach . If someone travel in group with tour guide , you can not change plans , You may go to beach on a rainy day . Also , you might go to somewhere you do n't want to go and waste hours in a bus .  People find tour guides because they are not good in that place . However , inventon of internet , and so much books about that place , tells everything about it . people can find maps , place where view is good , where to eat delicious food . Then people can choose place to go by themselves . My parents , once went to Italy , with only a book , and enjoyed everything without problems .  For these reasons , it is fun and also very practical to travel alone or in a personal groups . Flexible scedules and indivisual preference is the most important thing when people travel indeed .

I disagree with the given statement becuase I strongly believe that society has managed to reach the hieghts that it has today through specialization and division of labour . Specialization is a theory that emphasizes the importance of concentration in one particular field . When this theory was employed by factories and manufacturing plants , it resulted in a dramatic increase in production . Ofcourse specialization has its drawbacks and faults which are caused due to lack of knowledge in other fields , but the benefit of knowing one thing really well , greatly outweighs the faults of specialization .  A reason why specialization is so successful is because eventually ( usually after 12 years or so of schooling ) , people realize that they are better at somethings than other things , or they realize that they have a passion for a certain field and that that 's what they want to do for the rest of their lives . At this point in time it becomes apparent to them that other knowledge , that does n't further their understanding of their subject choice , is a waste of time . After all , if some one wishes to be a mechanical engineer , why does he need to know the literary feature that Shakespeare had used to capture his audiences attention .  I 've already decided what I want to do in life , and to tell the truth studying things like Spanish and Business seem to divert time away from my goals of becoming a research scientist . I love reading about the latest medical breakthroughs and discoveries , but all I get by learning Spanish is frustration and low marks . I sincerely doubt the importance of spanish in the long run , I mean sure it might help me communicate with people who only know spanish , but how many people will I meet like that . Through my personal experiences I 've learned the importance of knowledge in all areas , but I 've also seen the importance of specialization , and in my opinion , to know one thing very well is a lot better than knowing relatively nothing in everything ,	HIN
By the name of ALLAH In the first we will describe the main lines of our subject :: First : students understand ideas . Second : students concepts ideas . The main goal of this subject is `` learn facts '' . Now , I will begin from the presentation of subject to the students , it depends if the subject concern to the :  A. Scientific subject : I will say its not important to understand because the student should take the subject from other look , for example if the teacher talking about the sun rise from the east side no one must descuss the teacher for that because there is no result for the descussion if they talks days for that , they would not take any additional informations , so , I think and my opinion in the scientific subjects not important for students to understand ideas but may the teacher explain that upon the earth movement in short briefly words .  B. Art subject : now here the subject is opened why because the subject it has not any constant rather than the scientific subject . So , may the teacher gived the information to the students and part of them agree for that or may another part do not agree , for example let we talk about the beauty of the '' monaliza board '' , so may the most student agree there are secrets in her smile but not all could deal that set from the art or it came while he do not know - I talk about '' Leonardo Davincy '' , so I think not important for students to understand ideas and concept  C : Medical subject : that regards for the medecin students they must be understand every thing about humen there is no data pass as it is every details should be discussed , so here I think there is needing for the students to understand to learn the facts  Finally , I talk about subject from out look may my opinion is mistak but in the last I will say that not for the students schools because they in building stage they must understand every thing and my opinion may applied for the upstair students like in the university or high studentd levels , but I think you must understand to learn facts until the fact keeped in your brain as much as .

having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems more interesting than specializing in only one subject , however , we ought to determine all the advantages and inconvenients to make our mind ,  I am convinced about the great importance of mastering at least several subjects in order to increase our general knowledges , It seems nowadays indispensable to be aware of a lot of subjects that belong to varied for example , we are to be able to talk about politics , ecology , communication and business , and this would not be possible if we did not get broad knowledge in history , biology or mathematics , If not , we will not feel concerned about very important subjects that are part of our life , That the reason why we need to accumulate a lot of knowledge while we are still in college ,  After being part of this learning process , and only after that , you will be able to choose one specific subject that corresponds truly to your personality , your skills and your motivation . Then , you might be further in the subject you have chosen to express yourself in the best way , Whether if you were previously not interested in other general subjects , I am afraid that it would be difficult to envision things in a very mature and complete way ,  to conclude , you should have a look around you to be open6minded whatever your speciality may be in order to be able to use a wide range of skills ,	FRE
As we know every community was builded by their people . People such old persons or young persons work together to make great nations and provide good life .  In my opinion , I dont agree with the following statement `` young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping thier communities '' . Becouse the most important role in creating any powerful nation is her young people . Becouse they have the powerful and young mind to keep developing it . Nation that give the hand and support for its young people we found it aproud of its acheviments . Young people are participate in different side of coumminty . They work in teaching , engineering , medicene , and hand crafts to provide the good environment of raising new generations of young people . These new generations will continue carrying the future of the nation and its development . As we see today , in lebanon were the war is killing all people and destroying building . Young people stand thier to help their nation in hospitals and in places war arrive to it . And to share them their pain and fear . While other young people are standing to defend their lands from this war and its results . Young people give their lifes for the community and the nation should be the examples and the leaders for all young people around the world .  Finaly , nations and communities are measured by thier young people and their achivements . More powerful young people , more powerful nation it is an easy eqaution have just two variables . And the young people who raised on old people hands continue to carry the message for all generations come after .	ARA
The fact that the number of cars in use in the world has increased a lot since their invention is of course not discussed . But one can really ask himself if there will be more of fewer automobiles in twenty years . Despite the fact that we can truly believe , for several reasons , there will be fewer cars , I personally think there will exist more cars in use in twenty years than there is today . The main reasons of this theory are , first , that people had , have , and will always love cars . Second , an automobile is too useful for disappering from the surface of the planet . Third , the laws against pollution are not very effective .  First of all , people have deeply loved cars since the beginning , and there is no real reason why it will suddenly stop . Cars carry an image of wealth and happiness . It could also be part of certain dreams and fantasies since they were often use in movies , for example .  Moreover , a car is fondamentally very helpful . It is a convenient way of transportation , a very flexible one . My opinion is that there is not any other invention , to date , that allow people to decide to leave a spot for another one and go off immediately . I bet there will not be one either in the next decades . Another example of the usefulness of the automobiles is that you can put more personal stuff in it than when you travel by plane or by train for instance .  Finally , the political battles led against car pollution did not permit the number of cars to dicrease . Thus , I think this uneffectiveness will continue in the future . For example , if it is true that people driving cars in Mexico have to pay more taxes , it is still the most polluted city in the world , because of number of cars in use in this town is still the same . I think this will also continue in twenty years .  To sum up , there will be probably not be fewer cars in use in twenty years because of the three major reasons I expressed . But , of course , it is only a guess , since nobody , can really predict future	FRE
A world with fewer cars ! Sounds preposterous now . But I think this is going to be a reality in twenty years from today . There are various reasons why I hold this opinion . These include population growth , fuel crisis , and popular consciouness about environment .  The population of the world is only growing by the day . Naturally , we would expect more cars to roll on the roads . But , we do not realise that land is not growing in proportion to people . With limited land , there will come a time when we will not be able to find more space for our cars . Then the recourse is mass rapid transport system , which discourage car-use . This has already been seen in Delhi , India 's capital city where Delhi Metro Rail system has been created to deal with the stress that increasing vehicular population was creating . Now , we see that the number of cars have indeed come down on the roads because people find it more convenient to take a train to office , at a negligibel price , rather than maintain an own car .  Another reason why the number of cars might go down is the shortage of fuel . Oil crisis is here for real . It is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the energy need of the world . Very soon , the prices of oil are going to increase very highly . Early signs can already be seen . In such a case , running a car can be very expensive . Research on alternative fuels , like biofuels or solar power , is still in nascent stage . Thus , it will be very difficult for the common man buy fuel for his car . In India , the price of petrol has been increasing steadily and my family now goes out in car , only when it is really necessary or when all the four of us have to go out together . Otherwise , we use bikes or , simply , the public transport system .  The last reason why I think that cars are going to be fewer is popular sentiment against environmental pollution . Cars use fuel which increases environmental pollution . Therefore , some countries , like those in the Nordic region , encourage their citizens to use bicycles which are more eco-friendly . They are also a healthier option in comparison to cars as they keep the rider fit . Thus , concious citizens support such ideas . This trend seems to be catching up , which makes me believe that it will in future become very popular . In that case , the prospects for cars look bleak .  To conclude , I believe that cars are going to become rarer in the years to come because of a variety of factors . These include shortage of two resources : land and oil . These are going to be scarce because of growing population , in which case cars will not be viable . Finally , when people become more eco-friendly , they would look for options other than cars , which will affect the prospects of these automobiles .	TEL
Someone think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to sprcialize in one specific subject . In my opinion , But I disagree it . I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject . To have broad knowledge of many academic will cause many negetive results .  firstly , if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you must spend much more time to work hard . You will hvat to give up many other important things . You will not have enough time to play sports and your health will be worse . Otherwise , you will not have enough time to communicate with your family and friends . You will fell lonely after a long period .  Secondly , even you have spend so many time to work hard and you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects finally . But probably , you only know some common informations of many academic subjedts and are not good at one special subject . For example , a physician who know many knowledge of history , computer , plants and so on . He must have not enough time to study his medical knowledge , so he will not a good physician . Otherwise , if everyone all have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . In the result , they can do all kinds of job but they can not do them very well .  In a conclusion , I think people should have special knowledge in one specific subject and review broad knowledge of many academic subjects but not spend too much time on them . Because broad knowledge can give you more idea of your special subject .	CHI

I think successful people trying new things and taking risks when doing new things is better than doing what they already know . I agree with the successfull people , because if the people are successful for wat they are then they can be able to think for new things .  Obviously while trying new things risks may taken place , but if we are worrying about the risks then no one can be successful in their life . For example the scientists will produce new things by taking may risks if they are thinking that this work is very risky to do then now we ca n't get this light , radio , tv and satellites and many more which we are using in in our daily life . So for every achievement there are many risks taken for the things to do .  So successful people only can think of the future , for every achivement there are many risks taken by many persons for those achievements . For example if we are not trying for better future and being happy for what we have , then we will never succeed in our life .  Finally my opinion is to agree with the hard working people i.e. , successful people . Because if the people are not successful then they ca n't think for their further future . So for every success there are many risks had been taken to achieve it . So finally i agree that successful people try new things and take risks is better .	TEL
A lot of people always ask : `` would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject '' , and I always base my answer in my personal opinion to answer yes . I answer with a yes because if I have knowledge in many academemic subjects , I will have more options to find a job . I say is important to have knowledge in many subjetcs because the live in every country is different . The life is like fill with stones where you need to be prepare to move to do not fall .  I am a high school student hopping to get accepted in a university . I want to major in physics . I do not know if I will be able to find a job when I finish college , but I am sure the most I know , the more opportunities I will have to find a job . In the life is necessary to know a little bit of anything .  This is simple . I am from Ecuador , and in my country the life is very difficult . If I have knowledge in a specific subjet , I am no going to have any money to live like a normal person , this means , I can not pay for my food , I can not pay a place to live , and I can not pay my studies .  The life has stones . If I am invited to a important phisics meeting , I would know I am going to participate in the meeting , but what will happen if somebody ask me something different than physics , and I do not have an answer . I will be remember that pour situation for years and I do not want that .  Finally , if for any reasons that happen , that would encourage me to study more and more .	SPA
I agree that young people do not invest much time in helping their communities . There are many influences on all people , so also on the young ones , that are different nowadays and in the past . These influences change people 's behaviour .  In the past the personal contacts someone had was within a relatively small area and the dependency on each other was greater than today . Therefore there was more social community and also young people did their part for the community . Nowadays the range of people someone knows is spread over a much bigger area so that there is not longer the close relationship to people in your nearby community .  There are other factors that encourage young people to focus more on themsleves than on others . In the whole society there is the pressure of being successful with everything that someone is doing . Because these people need the time for being successful there is none or only little time left to spend it for the community . also , The interest moved from caring about the community to caring about oneself . Mainly people follow just their own business and do not care about others , wether they belong to the same community or not .  Another reason may be that life is more anonymous than it was in the past . People do not know each other , even if they live in one house , they might not have been met . If the people do not know their community , why and how should they care about them ?  Finally I would like to consider the point of responsibility for relatives and the money included . In the past families lived together much closer than nowadays . People have another opinion of being responsible . Today they do not care that much anymore about their relatives themselves , they rather care by spending money that someone takes care about the family member .  There are many influences today that are different in comparison to the past , that changed the willingness of young people to help their communities .	GER
Successful people tend to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  why I used `` tend '' above is that that is a possiblility , not an absolute solution for the successful people , otherwise the answer should depends on how to define `` successful people '' and how do successful people success ? If success means money , and someone who are called successful people comparatively , but not a real money bag like BIll Gates , there is no absolute answer for success . However , even in that case , the possibility for the success is consistently changing up to definition of success or how much are they successful .  Apparently , the possibility for success are given to the people who are willing to try something new . Because in the fields that have been well-known benefit makers . many people have already taken their benefits from that , not much things other people can gain and it could be called as monopoly . It 's like fossil fuel depletion . Small part of the world are still taking big gain from the fossil fuel , there is no chance to get entered in that industry , because that fileds are already full with prior property . In a given situation like their DNA , such as their looking or how they are smart , like how much money do they get from their parents , the possi ble way to improve their possibility for success is to challenge to uncovered world . Even though they are having the risky business which is originated from itself ( becuase it 's new ! ) the people who only doing what they already know how to do well can not easily catch up with those people who try to do something new and their great-great success rather than great or just success .  I am aiming great-great success like I wrote above , what i require to get the goal is to improve my credativity , to be enough creative to find something new and explore it . There is a word in my country `` If the water is stuck in one place , those will be decayed . ''	KOR
Traveling in a group led by one guide may have a number of advantages , while traveling in a group led by many guides to a trip may become harmful to the individual . Because of the sole guide 's control and ability to be followed necessarily , it is more beneficial for his group to follow him individually than to follow many guides .  Controlling the group of tourists by one controller is more beneficial for followers . The reason why is because one guide can govern his group so that no one else would affect his decision . Like the one heart of our bodies , the person who leads his group without any one else in a tour can make all of them to follow him necessarily . Otherwise , it is hard for them to continue their tour . For example , if they chose to follow more than one person , this person will say  If travelers depend on one guide in their tour , it , even if tall , will be more successful than if they choose to follow many guiders .

SUCCESFUL PERSON  I agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because they have creative , not hesitate personality , adn they do n't afraid .  People who try unique things and take risks can be creative because they are openmind and old things which are known are not enough for them , they are hungry new things . For example , in my country which still has been developing , a person started to sell a new kind mp3 player and he spent considerably huge money . While he was doing this , he took a risk because while he was doing it , there were many mp3 player and generally people do not want change their habbitant in my country . But he did not care it and he entered the almost evfery shops and people have started to buy this new kind of mp3 player and it has been common .  However people who take risks do not hesitate because they have challenging personality . Do a person hesitate while make a decision , he can not be succesful . Succesful person can make their decisions in every cicumstance . For example , my friend has a shop and it is almost 25 years old . There were a problem about economy in my country and many shop owners closed their shops because they could not stood agains it . Even though my friend suffered from it , he did not closed because he made some important decisions in this cicumstance , and he did not hesitate . Now , he is working in same place .  Also succesful people do not afraid from anything such try to do new thing . Some owners afraid from doing new thing , they think that if I can not sell it , I will lose my company . Even they who are company owner think like this , if they did it , they would earn more money and they would be big .  In conclusion one who take risks and do unexample thing , he or she will be succesful .	TUR
Like wars and foreign policy also a big part of our future depends on oil and fossil-resources . There are two possibilities in my opinion . The first one is that there will definitelty be fewer cars in use than today . Because there might not be enough oil to provide fuel for the millions of cars . But one has to considers that the consequence is that not only cars are affected . One could easily say that a car is not that important . But if there is no fuel left for the cars , there is either non for the bus , for a taxi , for the loanmower and for airplanes . Nobody will go nowhere . I personally could take my bike and go to the grocery store , but what for ? There will be no possibility to do my groceries because the shelves will be empty . If there is no fuel for cars , then there is no fuel for trucks that take the groceries to the supermarket . And this is only the peak of the iceberg . There will be no production , no traffic and even todays hightech might break down .  I do not want to paint this vision of the future too black . There is another possibility . Since we know that the whole traffic and one could even say the world is too dependant on fossil resouces such as oil , we could change that . There so many sophisticated scientists who work on solutions on how to gain energy . And they have results , like wind and sun als renewable enery resouces . We could already reduce the need for oil , if we for examlpe buz our vegetables from a farmer in our town . Then less truck would be needed . Whatever we do we need to start changing our energy-wasting habits now . Then in twenty years there might be as many cars as today but they will run with non-fossil energy . But I do definitely think that there will be less cars that run by fuel in twenty years .	GER
In my opinion fact is more important than the others . Because ideas and concepts can change easily but facts can not change because it is real thing . Somebody lived or something like that .  If we look all the history book that written about the world : We can see a lot of different idea and concept . For example : In World War II some country said that their country did the right thing and on the other hand their enemy said that they just defense their country so there were right . I can give more examples but i want to try to explain this example ; if you want to do something you have to have reason so it can not change person to person so it is real . But everybody have angle to look at the situation everbody can say i am right and this is ihe idea but no body change the facts .  If i want to learn something i really have to know facts . Of course we should learn the concept and understand the ideas but these are not the main things . Because i want to have my own opinion about something . However concept is important to create an idea but if you learn facts you can imagine the concept and you make your own trues .  Unfortunatelly this is really difficult , a lot of people choose the accept another peoples right . But not me .  If live in a democracy we have to decide our own way : We can choose our idea and concept . If we really want to do this we should have knowledge to say something which we have an idea . The last thing is i read a lot of thing about U.S. but when i went their i saw the real U.S. it was not the same as my past opinion . Thats why i can not totally believe all the ideas that some peoples has and i can not accept all the concept that somebody tell me .	TUR
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only diong what they already know how to do well . Most people wil agree on this statement , and few will not . What makes people believe in this statement or agree with it is that it 's true about successful people that they are risk takers . And what will make people do not agree with the statement is maybe because they think that taking risks is not what a successful person is based on . Its a matter of different opnion .  The causes why people belief in thsi statement is that , in business studies they study about successful people an about how can you be a successful business man when you grow up . So the thing is there is a chart listing the basic charcteristics of a successful person , and a risk taker is one of those basic characteristics an its actually one of the most important characteristics in a successful person . However , they agree with this statement because its based on true facts and on studies that have been taught for students in schools so they can not be mistaken or wrong in what they teach the students .  On the other hand , people who do not agree with the statement , is that they just belief in their own opinion and in what they think . And that 's not wrong , it 's good for a person to belief in himself . But ins ome cases you have make sure from what you say or what do you belief in , so for you to not be embaressed infront of other people .  At the end i would like to give my opinion , and its that i actually do agree with the statement . Because i studied in my school and specifically in business studies that from the main characteristics of a successful person is to be a risk taker an to try new things .	ARA
I believe that is better the person specialize in one subjetc . We need study evrything to choose this subjets , depending of as qualities . We qualities are so differentes one to the other , but always , we have more develop in one to the other . It is my opinion about this topics . .  For example : I love play tennis and I practice every day , I can play with the other person and understand everything about that . If I have a problem or the people ask me something about that , I can explain because I know about tennis .  But , if other people ask me to the soccer and he want play with me , is so different , because I 'm not play soccer and I not have practice to that sport .  If he teach me I will can play , but I 'm better to other sport .  If I want to learn to sports at the same time , I will learn but I ca n't develop all day in only one sport . I need concentration in the two sports .  We need have different observations about different subjetc or in this cause sport before to choose any one . Is neccesary stay sure about your decision .  Is the same with the subject 's , I can to learn the basic to each one but I need prepare in only and in my future will Know everything about my career .  If you can develop perfect the subject , now , you can find out to the other and can the same effort that the first .  Sometimes we hide many positive things , but we dont know about that , with the practice we can take off and show this hability !  we can plan our future is only our decision . but for my life or for you life is neccesary of the study .

`` Mom i do not want to to study these theories again and over again '' said my little child , so many questions about this crossed my mind like ; what is really more important for a student to know , understanding ideas and clear perceptions or take facts as they are printed in their text books ?  This issue that describes the types of learning , is really a contreversial issue for plenty of reasons , and as learning is concerned , i wish to see changes in the learning ways at many levels and angle. , I personally , strongly believe that a person in general , should be given the opportunity to understand the ideas and concepts , first , becasue that is what shape a person 's personality , let us take young children as an example , most of these children have their personalities shape when they turn ten years old , because all the abundant perceptions , knowledge , ideas and even things which they like and things , which they dislike have already configured , a soldier is another example , this fighter learnt the concept of loving his country when he was a kid , did not he ? !!  Another thing i would really do , if i had the chance to change something in how our young students should be tought , that i would build a whole city of learning , and i would make it unique in its given courses , it would be built based on the concepts of loylaty , love , team work and encouraging individual talents , moreover , no normal test would be giving , because they would be tought that the concept of examination is not always the right concept , also they would have weekly debates about larger concepts like enthusiasm , ethics , aesthetics and racism to have these young generations prepared to involve in real life life .  in conclusion , learning concepts is the best way for someone to have a balanced family , community and even country , because it is a circle of wise ideas , which never fails , in my opinion , no wars no violence would be existed if evaluating our concepts and respecting other concepts were every body 's dream to fulfill .

As the competiton increased belong the companies in almost every market , advertisiment become a very important way to improve the sales numbers . Companies use a lot of diffirent advertisement techniques . Accordingly It generally causes to make their products seem much better than they are actually .  For example when you watch a girl eating a canddy or a chocolate you probably want to eat that product as soon as possible . When you go and buy one then you understand that it is not as much delicious as you desired , but unfortunetly you have almost bought that product and this has increased the companies sales once more .  On the other hand some companies are aware of that , this will happen only one time . When you use and see the product does n't as good as seemed in the advertisement then you lost your trust to that company and never buy its products again . So they are triying to show the true qualities of the product for not making the customers dissappointed . When they are n't dissapointed , they always prefer to buy their products .  In conclusion , some advertisements may show the products better than what they exactly are , for improving the sales . But some firms can think different from that and plans long time process of its activities . I think the better way is always telling the truth . In that way people can trust your company , buy your products and in the future according to the high sales ' your company will most probably be a permanent company .	TUR
Youth represents a large percentage of the world population . Recently we had an increasing number of new formed organization , which are specialized in helping the community . most of these organization are constitute of young people . I do believe that young motivated people can serve and help there communities .  Young poeple are usualy highly motivated . but due to many circumstances they might not find the time or the appopriate way for helping their communities . for example I am a lawyer and most of the time I have to work for 10 to 12 hours per day . and during the weekends I usualy have papers to study and review . therefore I do not have that much time to do any social work . But that does not mean that I do n't want to , or that I find that helping my community is that not that important , it is just that the rythem of the fast world that we live in today , force us to fix some priorities first . But I do try my best to participate in any available community work that i can find .  During my college year I did a lot of charity and social work . I was a memeber of a social club , where we accomplished a lot of beneficial projects that I 'm really pround for being a part of it . And we were not the only club , there where over 50 clubs in my university . We believe that the important thing is to help the people who needs a hand , try to make there world a better place . like for example in the summer of 2002 , I participated in a project where we had to pant a primary school in a very poor district . The students of this school also helped us on this project , and it just felt great seeing these great smiles of happiness painted on there cute little faces .  I believe that the young people are a very important element of the society . But all they need is just to find the right directions . They are full of hope and faith and have alot to give . And that nowadays they do give there best to help improving there communities .	ARA
Some people said specialize in one specific subject is better than have knowledge or many acadamic subjects . Both opinions are good ideas but I agree with it 's better to hav broad knowlege of many acadaic subjects because thats helpful to meet varity of people in my life and every major is relative each other .  First of all , broad knowledge is helful in society . I 've been in New York City for 3 years now and I met a lot of different people during my New York life . I met a lot of people from other country , I could try differents food , I saw different customs and I saw a lot of different religens . That was the very first english class in New York I had 10 class mates in my classroom . Everybody was from different country and they introduce each other the first day of class . I thought I have enought knowledge about other country but some of my classmate , I hadnever heard there where their country is . That was very big shame for me and felt sorry to them . Our county also very small so some of our classmates did n't know where Korea is also still some peolpe ask me which part of Korea am I from . When they asked me I got shocked because north Korean ca n't move to other country . Korean who live in other country is all South Korean . For me that 's very basic knowledge but other peolpe does n't know . That time realized I should learn other culture because I was feel bad when they do n't know about my country .  Also , every major is relative each other . My major is interior design . Before I start to study interior design I thought I will learn only drawing and masearing . But when I start to study I should learn mathmatic , history , and art everything . I was wonder why should I have to take all this classes ? But after I start study , I realized why I have to study . I have to learn history how interior became and who start to design rooms and why . after learn history I could understand easily and faster . Also I took mathmatic classes that helped me to carculate all my masearment when I draw .  In conclusion , I agree with it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because that 's helpful to meet people in my life and every majors relative each other .	KOR
Specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects . A person must choose a specific subject to learn about because it will take a very long time to become an expert in a specific subject . When a person achieves this , he or she will make any jobs about that subject .  In developed countries , the teachers of young students observe their students and find out the areas which the students are more effective and then they asist their students on that way . Those students take the courses which their teachers directed to . Later in their higher education , they can choose a specific subject and they will be effective in that subject because their skills are usefull over that subject .  In the other hand if a person does not choose a branch to specialize , he or she will have knowledge of many academic subjects . That person can have little informations about many academic subjects . For this reason he or she can not be an expert of a specific subject . This is a big loose for him or her . That person will not find a good job and he or she will not have a good carieer for his or her future life .  If a person wants to have knowledge about many academic subjects , there is an alternative way to do ! At first that person should specialize in one specific subject than he or she will have education about other many academic subjects which he wants .  All the members of a soceity should be educated in one subject to give benefits the his or her society . This is very important to have an active role for the development of a person 's society or country .	TUR
Getting success is not an easy job in any field . You need to work hard and struggle for what to wish to achieve . People who have succeded in their work try to to make new things and take risks as success gives them a boost to excel in thier field .  Once a person is successful in achieving his target he will try out new things and would like to explore more and more in the same filed and to apply in various other fields . Consider an example of Sir Issac Newton . If Sir Issac Newton would have just stopped his theory of gravity after its discovery then many things would have been undiscovered till now . He applied his theory in the field of mathematics , physics , science to name a few . Just think if Sir Issac Newton would have stopped taking risks and searching for new principles and theories then advancement would not have been possible . The laws would have been at the receiving end . One more great scientist to name will be Einstein . He proposed the theory E = mc2 , the theory of relativity . He started using the concepts in his surroundings which stunned the entire world . These great mens did not stop after achieving their targets but used their success as the tool to find out various new things .  If the person who is success and does not wish to explore the field of his interest then the success will be of not much importance . Doing what which is known can be done by others too but implementing it can be done only by few , who assume their success as the strength to discover what is not known . Being wise is good by applying your theory in a different manner but to get success you need to implement your theory in various fields .  Successful people will always make an attempt to make new things and take risks . They will never make their success as the ending point of research or work . Success is not the end . Keep on trying and taking risks will surely benefit even though you might not get success on each and every step you choose to take .	HIN
I certainly disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . I will explain my point of view along with some examples .  First of all this statement can not be generalized . There might be some young people that do enjoy their life more than some people that are older . Although I do not think this is connected with their age but more with a general attitude towards life . For example an older person could be more pessimistic than a younger person . But this person might have been more pessimistic througout his hole life , even when he or she still used to be young .  I do believe that there is different ways of enjoyment and different areas that old and young people do get enjoment from . In my opinion this is connected to the differentent life spans people are in at different ages . Each life span , like the toddler 's , the teenager 's or the adult one , brings along different tasks . Let 's say a teenager does live more on the riskier side of life and does take drugs from time to time or have more liberal sex habits than an adult would practize , this might be due to his wish to experience independence or to define his own personality by testing his own and the society 's limits . That is a normal behavoiur for his age and role in our western society . In todays society a more liberal way of life and expression is often taken as a symbol for a happier life . This does not neccessary hold true . Some of these teens , asked about their amount of joy in life , might not be happy with what they have at all . On the other hand an older adult , living more quietly with his family and having a satisfiying job , might not look as happy at first but if asked migth show a quiet high level of life satisfaction . This so called joy in life could maybe better be described by the word happiness or life satisfaction .  Also another point is that there is a confusion between seeing the older people 's life style , that indeed might look a little boring an less enjoable to a younger person , as connected to their age . Even when the really old people of todaz were young their values were different to ours . Thez just continued living them until today . This is not boring for them , but to us it looks b	GER
These days a large number of people say that leraning facts is the most important and substantisal way to improve themselves . However , I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand idea than to learn facts because students with ideas or concepts can enable people to explain things more efficiently and students have more time to spend studying than do adults . The main reasons are as follows .  One reason that students should put higher priority on ideas or concepts than on facts is that ideas and concepts can help people to explain things logically . To be more specific , studens can classify , confirm and assure things with fixed ideas . For example , my brother always tell me the reason why things go on as it do because he studied a lot of ideas and concepts in his university . However , I did not study ideas . So my knowledge is just only from experience or facts . To be honest , it is quite difficult for me to explain something to other people because I do not understand the real ideas or concepts . Many people told me that they do not understand my explanation at all . That is why I thing to learn ideas is the most important .  The other reason that students can have better benefit from ideas than facts is that students have more time studying ideas than does adults . That is to say , even if adults want to study ideas , it takes long to learn concepts of things . For example , as I mentioned above , my brother studied ideas and concepts in his university . I actually envy him because he can explain things better than I . So I decided to learn concepts by mysefl . However , sicnce I am working for a company six days a week , I did not have enough time to learn ideas enought . Hence , I regret not studying ideas in my university .  In conclusion , I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than is is for them to learn facts , for the above reasons . When I have children , I will force them to learn ideas and concepts in their universities in order not to have trouble explaining people .	JPN
Yes , i am totally in agreement with the notion that it is better to travel in group instead of travelling alone led by a guide . Actually , in todays materialistic world their is more safety concern then ever before . so it is wise decesion to travel in group .  For ex , if a person travels in a new town or country and he does know not anything about the new place . Then it is better for him to travel in a group because it lessen his chances of being confused in an unknown place . A person could be face a lot of defficulitios ion new place like where to stay , have food and some times he may encounter langauge problem . so travelling in group with guide will be helpful option . .  Travelling in group led by guide is very good choice , because the guide is familiar with local language , culture which helps a lot . Actually , travelling with a guide enhances your joy of the trip because he can tell u a lot about the the places you are touring . Further it is also cheaper economical to travel with many people . Beause in group everybody is contributing in the whole cost which is mostly less then the cost of travelling alone .  Exploring a exile place in alone is not a good option because sometime their are few minor prolems regarding to security which may encounter by an single traveller . For instance like a person is going to catch a train in a railway station and someone steel his purse , then he feel that he is in critical dillemma . Actually , there are few thieves who attack on alone and new traveller . But if you are teavelling in group , they can not dare to steel your thing or you can con = mpliant with your group members .  Basically , travelling alone in a new and unknown place is always a risky task , one should have to be very careful about himself as well as his luggage too . On the other hand travelling in group secures a person from these minor problems .  At conclusion , it is a good and intelligent idea to travell in group with the guide . It makes you safer and allow to enjoy journey .	HIN
I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks to achieve thier goals . Only if there are risks the life will be more interesting . And also if we work on the same things we will feel bored . For example if a software engineer works on a same project for several years then there will be no improvement in his techical skills or i will actually lose his imagination power . Only if he works in differnt scenarios he can improve his own and knowledge and gain experience  `` Mukesh Ambani '' is the best example i think because first he is a successful person in variuos kinds of business . First along with his brother he started industries and developed those industries to gain more profit . Then he started oil refineries and then comes the reliance mobiles . Apart from this reliance energy resourses are doing a great job in the mutual funds and share markets .  This also helps to provide job for people in different fields . If there is only one industry then we can support only the people who are in that field . By trying new business also helps to reduce unemployment and to develop various economic level .  Another one reason of doing variuos business is if there is loss in one of the business we can manage the lose because of the profit in other business . In case we are doing a one business then we can not manage that situation . Eg . Learning both hardware and software will help when there is less number of jobs available in software or hardware . So if we learn more and keep you update to date with the new technologies then there is no way for loss .  May be there are successful people who does the same which they know ( same bussiness ) but the probablity is very less . Trying new things and developing the new skill sets will give us in good position	TEL
Education is one of the most important engine of human , society and economic development . However , ways to conducted education through learning differ . For some authors , it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . For some other , learning facts is more important . Here ( my opinion ) , it is question to show that learning facts will be better . In other words , I will show why I disagree with the statement using two examples .  First , this example is related to the field of Mathematics . It is abvious that fact students involved in memorizing theories , assumptions , propositions and theorems related to Mathemathics will have much difficulties to remember most the theories . For that reason , software applications are , in somehow , a way for students to remember easily what they have studied . This example can be applied in may other fields like economics , agriculture , etc . For students in agriculture to really have a deep understanding and clear knowledge of what they have learnt , they need to be in the field or in greenhouse in order to apply the basic theories on chemistry , agronomy and so on .  The second example is related to the first steps of the education . During my primary school , I have visit some historical places in the framework of our class of History and Geography . A historical place like Goree ( with its Slavery House ) is still scanned in my memory , and the explanation of the guide also , as if I was in that place during the Slavery Trade . Compared to the people that have never been in that place , I am more able and more likely to talk about History .  To conclude it can be said that as witnessed by the use of softwares in the Social Sciences and through my experience , I can	FRE
There is an ongoing debate whether it is best to travel in a group with a guide or not . Some people insist that it is better to take a trip alone because it allows you explore the new environment freely . However , I strongly believe that following a tour guide with a group of people is the most efficient way to travel because people can enjoy the most beautiful and popular sites in short time and also they can learn interpersonal skills by socializing with the team members .  First and foremost , with a leader who knows about the sites people can save their time to enjoy the most renowned places . Some people says that this kind of traveling does not satisfy every other members in the group . However , as the guide have experienced every kinds of travelers , he/she surely would be able to schedule the best course for the most members . According to a survey released by the Korean National Research Center , more than two thirds of the surveyed people who had traveled abroad responded that they would like to take a trip with a tour guide who knows about the places . In this survey , they answered that a tour guide who have already took numerous trips would be able to lead them to the most magneficient and indispensable spots they ca n't miss . Also they replied that as they have the best way to drop by all the remarkable places in their heads , it would save their time than traveling all by themselves with a piece of map . Therefore , traveling with a tour guide as a member of a group is the most time-saving and efficient way .  Moreover , by socializing with others in a group , people would be able to have more benefits . In these days , social skills are considered to be important requirements to move up the ladder . And by traveling in a group , they can achieve needed interpersonal skills . For example , an adult who decides to take a part in a group \ traveling india has to deal with troublesome behavior and incomprehensible words from others . In this process , he/she would be able to learn how to remain calm on the face of others ' irresponsible behaviors and eventually be on good term with them . Traveling in a group will finally turn out as a precious memory of not only having been to various kinds of spots but also making relationships with many different kinds of people . Furthermore , he/she would be able to success with the social skills he 've got . In this sense , traveling in a group does good to eaxh individual by teaching them how to harmonize with others .  All in all , traveling in a group is the most recommended way to take a trip because it is the most efficient method with a guide and people can achieve social skills by it .	KOR
In the fast growing world job opportunities are growing . All the subjects have sub-subject to work on it or new working areas . Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well because of ; earning money and reputation , peoples attention and being imaginative .  First , earning money and reputation is the base of all kind of work and success . People always want money and reputation , at least one of them . Trying something new will always bring you the money or the raeputation . For example if whe think about a good car mechanic , and known by his own neighbourhood stats working on luxury boats engines . A while later his customers will start to want his help in boat subject or something else about mechanics because they will think that he is gifted about mechanical things . So trying new things brings you both money and reputation and these two courages to try more new things again .  Secondly , people 's attention makes you happy bacause everbody ask you something about the thing you have done or invented , wants something about it or come near to you and say ` congratulations` . The point is that you are the center of the world at that moment , you think that everything happening is about you everyone loves you everyone needs you , this is the food of the human soul and the key for t the success so peoples attention is one of the most important points of trying or doing new things .  Last , only imaginative people may try new things because they are the ones who try the not-tried things before . Their brains are succesfull until their birth , may be they are really gifted or the ` one` . They can assemble a world only for theirselves and kive in it . When they imagine something they can also imagine the result . What does that change ? If they do not see the succes at the end , they do not go in to the new things , their brain is working in a different way , they are smart .  In conlusion , trying new things and the success related to it is about money , attention and being imaginative . People trying new things can be succesful but sometimes only succesful people can try new thing because they already have enough courage and brain for that . This is a two directed road , someone in this road will be olways successful or always try new things . And it will end with the other one .	TUR
i think that learning facts and understanding ideas are both important to know everything you could possibly know about a certain subject .  but when it comes to what is more important i think that understanding concepts and ideas is the reason why there is facts for example if a scintest didnt try new experements and went to knew plases and learnd new concepts he could never come up with a fact that everybody studies and knows .  usually a fact is more respected than a concept because the fact is certain and its there to see or to check but the concept may be a littel frightning because its hard to predect wether it is going to be a fact or the people will simply forget it therefore the people rather to study a fact-full major than a concept major at the university .  all the new cars and the new building start as a concept and the engineers modify it as they want and when they are all done they start doing the project , after the project is introduced it becomes a fact for everyone who doesnt know about the concept in the first place .  denying that the facts are important in our lives is wronge but i think that they are less important than the concepts . for example the fact is a result of a long-time thinking and studying ready to read and learn in a number of lines , so it is much easier to learn an existing fact than to think about one using concepts and ideas .  finally if a person wants to get the best possible of knowledgment he should consider and study both facts and ideas becaus the start of every fact is to prove the idea and introduce the concept .

I completely agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . Our modern world is full of such examples where people took risks and created new things . Upto a large extent , our modern age is made by these people . I will classify these activities in mainly two ways .  First , where people just change the way in which we do things . For example , take the music industry . Few year backs , music industry was dominated by the Walkman from Sony . If you wanted to hear music then you need to buy a walkman and cassettes . Sony thought that this was the best way but Steve Jobs from Apple had different ideas . He created i-pod where you can download your music in flash memory . This was more efficient and one can download large amount of music that was not possible with Walkmans . This made Steve Jobs famous but Sony lost a market because Sony executives were just making more efficient Walkmans . They never tried to try a new thing .  Second , where people leapfrog the current way of doing things and create a totally different solution of the problem . For example , take the postal services . Earlier , if you want to send a letter to your loved ones then you have to write that in paper and send it by mail . It used to take time and process was in-efficient . Few people thought about the electronic transmission of information and internet was born . Now , sending a letter to someone is a click away by e-mail . E-mail is much efficient and much faster .  Some people will not agree with the statement and they will say that trying new things is risky so we should not try new things . I would like to tell them that if our ancestors would have thought in the same way then we would have been living in stone world today . I agree that once you try new things then you might fail , but , learning lessons from failures and trying again makes some one successful .	HIN
I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . If one were to analyse the traits of successful people in the area of business , entertainment , sports or even politics , the one common trait to emerge will be their ability to take intelligent and thoughtful risks and keep pushing the boundaries of their area of expertise . Human beings are loath to change and do not like to get out of their `` comfort zone '' . The average person would rather continue to do what they know very well because of the overall disruptive nature of `` change '' . Trying new things is generally viewed as too risky to compromise a steady state of existence and established livelihood . But over time it becomes necessary to change , adapt and try new things because there are always others who would be willing to do the same thing in a better , efficient way or for a lower price . The only way to combat becoming redundant and remain successful is to embrace change , experiement with new things and take calculated risks . As an example , if you look at the traditional telephone companies or the media business , they have not changed in their behaviour or in their business processes in the past century . The business owners believed in their own perpetual existence and were continuing to do what they had been doing all along . But , with the advent of new technology and the internet , their world has been rudely shaken . The number of adults who read a newspaper has been steadily falling . Most new telephone connections are now of the `` wireless '' variety . Unless these traditional companies shake up their business and take a few risks on their own , they are doomed . Infact , the cycle of change and innovation has significantly crashed over the past few years . Even the internet companies and wireless telephone companies have to constantly reinvent their business and continually try out new things to stay relevant in todays world .  The concept of trying new things and taking risks is also important from an overall `` evolution '' standpoint . Imagine if Bill Gates or Michael Dell had not continued to experiment in their garages , or had given up on their dreams and ideas , we would still have been using the abacus for adding numbers . All successful businesses and ideas are based on the bedrock of `` new ideas '' and `` new concepts '' and it takes brave , committed and passionate individuals to keep taking such risks and expanding the boundaries of knowledge . While the rewards for taking risks are typically huge , the rewards are not quite obvious till such time a risk is taken .  In conclusion , the appetite for risk and trying new things are the defining traits for successful individuals in this world .	HIN
I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  In my observation from the successful businessmen or professors , they often do things or sucjects what other people do not understand at all . For example , ten years ago , while most people do not know values and benefits of the computer , but Bill Gates knew it . Because he went ahead and tried the new things ( computer ) , he made a real big fortune from doing latest technology .  On contrary to those persons who only do what they known , successful persons are always trying new things . They usually have a open mind to absorb all the latest concept , and they often take risks . For instance , if a businessman adopt the idea that he never heard before , it must be very risky to use it if the idea is not pratical to operate .  There will be two different ways for using the new thoughts : success or fail . Most people will not dare to adopt new things because they are afraid that they may lose everything . In this way , they gradually developed the idea that they do not want to learn the new things and take advantage of them .  In contast , this idea seldom be formed in the heart of successful people . They , of course , know the risks might be , but they are not afraid . Successful people usually have a positive mind to keep them go ahead .  In conclusion , I think that I truly agree the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .	CHI
I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . As a matter of fact , people who are open-minded , manage their time well and work hard , regardless of old or young , can enjoy their life without questions .  A bright and vigrous young spirits may have more curioisties than older people to explore the world . They are bound to learn any information they are enthusiastic with . They may have lots of social activities they have to participate in such as parties , concerts and sports and make friends . However , a young people who grew up in a dysfuncitonal families with narrow-minded , may not have moods to learn and play . They may fall in the depression and hateful environments and kill time by doping drugs or hook around . They drop out from schools and do not know what to do . They do not know how to manage themselves and their time as well , so there 's no good life they can enjoy .  On the other hand , a great deal of vivid older people may retire from their jobs and they are veterans who save pensions and good at how to lead a beautiful life . They manage their time carefully . They may get up in the morning to take a walk at the park , read newspaper on the bench and enjoy sunshine , arrange a nice trip and visit old friends sometimes ; cultivate hobbies to make their child 's dream come true . Some older people who do not manage well from their youth may suffer financilly difficulty to organize their life . They are sick and can not go anywhere . Illness brings hard and unhappiness life for them .  Therefore , no matter young and old , people can enjoy life easily if they appreciate how precious life are and manage their times well and keep open-minded .	CHI
I agree with the statement that says that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . First , if I go back in time and I start to do some memories of my time as an students at School and at the University , all those things that I learned it was because I understood the ideas and concepts that my teachers explained to me and my classmates . When I finally understood the process of the French Revolution I never forget it , because I did n't learned it as a fact .  Second , is really great when you get the concepts of the different things and you can start to make some interesting relations between them and with the experience of your own life . I think that is nice when you can make questions about what you learned and give some conclutions about it . I also found that is nice when you meet with friends and you start a conversation with them , talking and exchanging ideas of all those things that in a moment you learned and understand them . I really have a very good time when I have those kind of opportunities to share with friends what I have learned and also to be sure that I can do my own statements .  Futhermore , I consider that Facts are too weak , you learn this facts for the test and then you erase them . Is like a foreing learning , from one moment to onother it flyes away , from your mind . Instead , when you really understand the ideas or concepts yo can be sure that this knowlege will never forget , never more .  Finally I can say that , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .	SPA
I am disagree with the statement . I think that it is more important to learn that we all can prove as facts .  First , Not every thing we understant as concept or idea is a fact . For instance , when we learn an specific topic in economics we spect that it will works every time . But that it is not true , a well known case is the way that one must take a desicion in a game , remember John Nash equilibrium .  Sencond , it is more easy to memorize a fact that a concept . We all know that two plus two is four . On the other hand , try to understand how physics explain the earth 's movement .  Finally , There are alot of research in each area that when we understand a concept imediatly arise a new theory explaining the same concept . For example , Pluto is not a planet when I was a child everybody known that Pluto was the converse .  For all I wrote above I can sincerely say that to learn facts is more important for students .

Learning facts is undeniably a necessity for all students of all ages . That is even the fist thing that a child is asked when he enters school . He learns rules , such as standing straight and in line before entering a class , or not walking around while the teacher is giving a lesson . Those rules are transferred to him before the notion of good and bad , he understands the consequence of his ations earlier than the reasons for their necessity , and acts consequenty . In our school systems , learning prevails upon assimilating , at least at the beginning .  The expectations necessarily evolve with the age of the students . In higher grades , it becomes almost impossible to learn by heart without understanding . Assimilating a concept is likely to develop the cleverness of a student while learning will only fil his memory . As school is supposed to learn children how to think , learning becomes of lesser importance from a certain age .  Yet , learning is still necessary for exams , for proving one 's ability to memorize combined with one 's intelligence . Also , as it is the only mean by hich one can assess a student motivation at work and ability to memorize , learning can not be neglected as a key factor in a student 's success and in a whole school system .  For a student 's personal development , understanding concepts and ideas is obviously more important and almost necessary , but it does n't supress the learning part , which is much more easily assessed on a copy for example .  This raises the question of the role of school . Indeed , if it is only supposed to insert people in their future professions , the ability to learn fast and a lot prevails innevitably . But school is also supposed to be the fundametal pillar of a nation , as it strutures people 's mind and is therefore essential in a democracy for example .	FRE
Everyone has one day dreamt of inventing something new which would make him rich and successful . I must say I believe in people 's intelligence . I mean that we are all capable of inventing something which will make us rich . So I do agree with this statememt because being successful is only the last thing you get when you try new things .  When you try new things you do it because you think that what you are trying worth the energy you are spending to do it . You are ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish what you began . You are over motivated and that 's why you succeed in you attempt . This motivation shows your ambition and that 's how you are going to make it . For example the film Beatrix Potter shows why she became famous , that 's because she knew her idea was good and she had enough motivation to get refusals and to be desapproved by her father .  And once you have succeed you always want to have this feeling again . The feeling that nothing can stop you , like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic , you think you are the king of the world . If you try something new or to invent something it is because you do n't like to do always the same thing even you can do it very well . It is a lot more exciting to invent something , to think day and night on how you can develop an idea and make it real .  Finally , you try new things because it makes you successful . You do n't like to be like everyone else , you want to be apart of the others . And even if you are doing something very well you have to try new things or a new way to do it because it will show that you do n't rely on your knowledge . It will show that you really want to improve yoursel . Mozart is considered as a genius because he not only knew how to play an instrument very young but also because he created symphonies at a very young age .  As a conclusion I would say that everyone should try new things , it is not interessant to rely on what someone else crated for us . We have the try something new as well .	FRE
I claim learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts . I explain my idea by using the example of controversy of article 9 of Japanese constitution .  Just knowing the ideas and concepts do not directly mean we have the understanding on the topic and having the opinion to act for it . Thinking about the controversy over article 9 , the argument wether revising it or not . Surely , understanding its history that have kept our country peaceful for 60 years , and its idea and concept of renouncing the war after the tragetic memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is very important . But by just `` understanding '' the ideas of exsitance of it , we can not protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism .  So what are we needed to live ? We are strongly needed to be `` learning '' the facts of the Japan facing now , and the ways we can take for maintaining the peace . What happens when North Korean missile are launched to Japan ? Do we not fight for it ? Or we fight with self defence forces which is well known to be not suit the article 9 itself .  Therefore , understanding the ideas and concepts are not helpful in our lives . It is a very idealism . Its good to have , but does not do anything to us . It 's not practical . What I want to claim in this essay is that is not the importance of article 9 , but that learning facts and to know what we can do for it next , is much more important in our real lives .	JPN
It is often said that young people 's interest in their communities has been decreased recently . Some people might agree with this opinion because of the society getting more and more individualistic . However , I disagree with the idea that the young spend much time for communities because of what schools and societies require for them .  To begin with , schools encourage students to more actively participate in the community service . Many schools , nowadays , offer volunteering programs for additional credit or elective courses . To support this point , studies done by the Ministry of Education of Korea have shown that the number of official community service provided by educational organizations such as high school and university has been 67 % increased compared to that of 10 years ago . Also students ' participation for these programs has been 87 % increased . It seems clear that schools have a positive influence on young people 's assistance for their communities .  Moreover , societies put more stress on helping communities . Communities display a lot of advertisements to get help from young people and their participation is highly praised by the society . The young peoplebeing considered as virtuous are rewarded by the government making their name on the local periodicals . For example , I happened to see the poster for rebuilding of my community damaged ny huricane earlier . I immediately made my mind to be part of it as the team leader and awarded by the represent of my village . This volunteer experience written on my resume greatly affected the employers of my current work . They said virtue of helping others is the very criteria they esteem .  In short , I disagree with the opinion that young people spend not enough time for communities to make them better . This is because of encouragement of schools and societies .	KOR
The argument that successful people are characterized by being people that continuously take risk and enter new ventures , and avoid tasks that they are familiar with is controversial one . On the one hand , more risk means more return , and greater chances of reaching and building creative ideas and results . On the other hand , working on a task that you know well will promise sure success , as compared to risky avenues that have a tendancy to results in huge failures as much as resulting in successes . Personally I believe successful people are the ones that stick to the tasks that they can master , and I support my argument with the following three reasons .  First , entering risky avenues without the knowledge and experience in the chosen risky task is similar to a gamble , the chances of winning are equal to the chances of losing . It may also be that the chances of losing are higher , as any task requires the performer to learn and educate himself , and also familiarize himself with the task . Take snowboarding as an example , you ca n't successfully snowboard without practicing for long hours and taking lessons , you will end up injured .  Second , working on things that you are familiar with is the beginning of any process of innovation . A number of human resource books state that any process of innovation within any field first requires that you have the knowledge and experience within this field .  Third , a number of losses faced by risk takers that enter fields they have no knowledge about lead to very severe losses that may very likely impair the person 's ability to undergo other tasks in the future . As an example , the market crash in the late 1990 's lead to subtantial losses for the naive investors that devoted their time and a significant amount of their savings in a venture that they had no knowledge about . Many really went bancrupt , lost their families , and their health .  All in all , I believe success can be reached if people undertake the tasks they are familiar with . A the choice of the familiar task leads to a much more positive outcome , compared to an outcome of entering risky avenues that you have no knowledge about .	ARA
In the past years , we have seen a growing conflict between older and younger people . In many countries , the gap between generations is growing , due to demographic as well as sociological developments .  Unemployment of young people is a hughe problem in many european countries . In many cases , young people are not able to get a good education because of their immigration-background or their social environment . Also , many young people are not able to find proper jobs although they have good education because after massive job cuts in many multinatinal companies , no youngsters are hired at the moment due to slow economic growth and the consequences of globalisation , which often causes outsorcing and transfering of jobs from expensive first world countries to areas , where production is cheaper .  On the other hand , also older people are affected by these job cuts . At the same time , european welfare-states have to raise the retirement age in order to keep their social systems functioning and financeable .  Of course , this development sometimes causes frustration on both sides . When older people who either have the will to work but do n't find a job or who have worked for decades and are now retired see young people in the streets , hanging out , doing nothing ( except skateboarding , listening to music , playing computer games and shopping ) they might get the impression , that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age . And that impression , in my opinion , is probably correct . When todays old generations were young , in the fourties and fifties , there was not a lot of fun stuff to do in Europe . They experienced the cruelty of the World War II and the hard work that was necessary to rebuild the countries afterwards .  Young people in Europe are lucky , to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment . They have the chance to do things , older people were not able to : they can travel , they can communicate with strangers and friends around the world , they can get to know the world in a totally different way their parents , grand parents and grand grand parents were able to . They have the time and possibility to do sports and ofther fun activities and to enjoy their life - maybe more , or at least in a different way , than many older people do .  Maybe this way of lifestyle many young people have , containing travelling , extreme sports and other ways to test their personal limits , are a way to cope with their `` Zukunftsangst '' , with the scary feeling many youngsters have , that they have to be flexible all the time , they often do n't know , what tomorrow brings them and they are not sure , if and how long they will have a job ( and if they are lucky to have a job , they have to pay for the older people 's retirement , probalby without beeing ever able to profit from this system themselves ) .  I think , young people have all rights to enjoy their live as long as they can - sooner or later it will get tough anyway . Older people should n't complain about this but rather try to understand the situation , teenagers and twens are in . And sometimes they should even talk to their grand children and tell them : `` It 's alright , enjoy your life . Go and have some fun ! ''	GER
Some peple like indivisual travels , others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide . In my opinion , I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . I would like to show three points referring rationals and examples .  First of all , a group trip makes us easy to go unfamilier spots in the famous sight seeing places . Since tour a guide has professional knowledge on the place , they can advise us to see unknown but good spots . In my experience , when I went to China in a school trip , I could find beautiul scene of forest and rivers from unknown spots . If I had not travel in a group , it mutst have been impossibe since I was unfamilier with China .  Also , a tour guide can help us to communicate efficiently with foeigners in a foeign travel . In general , a tour guide , especially who often goes to foegin countries , has a good command of the ingenious languages . Therefore , we can communicate with ingenious people through their language help . If we do not have tour guides , especially in foreign countries which we have not learned the languages , we can not directly communicate with them . Since one of big advantages to go abroad is to communicate with native people , and to learn the life and culture , no language support does not bring beneficial time .  Lastly , referring to an advangage of a travel in the form of group , it ensures to communicate with other people who are in the same tour . It is a good opportunity to see other people , because , in my case , I do not have much opportunity to meet other unfamilier Japanese . Since I am a university student , I always meet same people such as classmates or friends who belong to the same club activity . If I could meet someone who have same the tasts , I would be able to have eternal relationship with them .  Thus , due to three points : going to unfamilier spots , communication with ingenious people , and having relationship with people in the same travel , I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

I disagree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I think the best way to travel is alone or with a freind . There are two reasons . First , it 's more free . Second , bagpack is more exciting .  The first reason is that I have much more free time than in a group . Th be specific , I can go wherever I want and spend a lot of time in some place without any resistant . If I want to go shopping , I do not care other people . So I can go small shop and see aroud where I intersting . That means I have freedom in a trip .  Second ting , It is more exciting . For example , when I vistied Italy last years , I stayed youth-hostel . In there , I made friends who came other country . So , we went popular spaces , restaurant , park and river together . Until now , I contect her by email . Even if I had not plan go concert in Italy , I saw the pamplet and went there . I can not forget that concert .  That 's why I think best way to trevel is alone or just with a friend .	KOR
I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are . In all kind of advertisements , specially in those we can whatch by television , the products are presented like incredible objet which can satisfy any our request !  There are lot of workers employed in theese organized machine having the purpose to sell the largest quantities of a certain kind of products . Obviously I think that the production companies couldn ` t sell a very different product of what we can see by television or newspapers , because people would not buy again a bad product .  I think that advisors are concerned to show a thing in its better face , trying to emphatize some qualities and trying to hide the lack pointsof a product . They often provide to offer examples of satisfacted consumers which are enjoied to be	ITA
Some people are saying that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their communities ; however , I disagree . By careful observations , I believe that young people nowadys do give enough time to help their communities .  There are several ways to help the communities such as by volunteering , caring for people , participating in community activities . Many young people today make contributions to their communities by participating in volunteering jobs . A recent news report in Taiwan has shown that more and more students today are willing to volunteer at places including libraries and hospitals , during their summer vacations . This may seem common in America , however , it 's a revolutionary trend in Taiwan . Ten or twenty years ago , students in Taiwan were regulated by their parents to only focus their attention on their studies . Young people during that time were educated to only care about themselves , about their studies and were not allowed to do `` un-paid '' works such as volunteering jobs . However , during recent years , young people are more willing to sacrafice their time to do volunteering works which shows that young people today spend more time on helping their coummunities .  In addition , young people today cares more about people , even animals in their communities . There was a horrible news about a man who abuse cats in his home recently in Taiwan . The man force his cats to drink detergents and made them make bubbles . And then , his took pictures of this abusement and post them on the internet . The young people in Taiwan were irritated by his actions and by cooperations , track down the man 's internet IP address and located where he live . Consequently , the man was punishment by the police of his actions , due to the help from these young people who cares about animals .  Furthermore , many young people particpate in their community activities . For example , I have a friend that join the dance club that is held by his coummunity . He was able to meet lots of people with similar interest for that particular club . And if members from that club has problems , he would try to help them at no costs .  Finally , young people today do give time in helping their communities . And this trend can be easily found by careful observations .	CHI
The knowledge about the various academic subjects is good for every person because we can familier with all the subjects and we can share our ideas with all kinds of people , who came from different background . But specialization is also good because we can go throw the deeper levels of the subject . When I consider carefully these two , I prefer specialization in one specific subject .  First , in the specialization we can go to bottom levels of subject that means we have a chance to find out new things from important information . This is will comes only , if we have reached the bottom levels also . When I was in btech i found one new program about the colors in java . I studied the entire subject in summer thats why I found the new program . My college staff appreciated me alot .  Second , in the specialization we can findout the drawbacks about the subject thats why we can find the solutions to prevent it . Moreover we can reduce if possible . If see the scientists , they try to reduce the harmness to `` ozone '' layer . They are specialists in related subjects and try to reduce harmness to `` ozone '' because they know the merits and drawbacks about the subjects .  Third , the specialist only knows the all information about the subject . In this case I have one bitter experience that is , few monts back I met an accident to my leg . At that time I went to one hospital , the doctor was not a specialist in bones . He said that there is no injury to ur leg but . i	TEL
In order to compare the lives of young people and older ones , it seems necessay to start off with a brief description of that average young and the average older person .  Young people enjoy themselves in activities such as meeting friends , going out , doing sports or listening to music . On one hand , these activities are fun and help a young person to relax after an exhausting day at school or work . But on the other hand all these activities can not be enjoyed without a certain amount of money . Because of that , young people can easily get into a rush of working real hard , maybe even having a job while studying at a high school or university , and spending the money in the evenings and on their weekends . They keep switching directly from the status of making money into spending it and forget to just settle down for a moment and simply sit down and read a book or something like that .  Sometimes young people even start working almost nonstop so that they can just stop most of their work and have fun later in life , which is the worst of all cases .  Older people are usually the opposite . Most of the retired people enjoy a slow day without getting in rushes or being stressed . They have no fear of sticking to everyday habits , which provides a basis for a settled and enjoyable life . They do n't feel like they miss out on things when they go to bed early every once in a while which is a problem a lot of young people share .  If people try to compare these two different types of enjoying life , a basic problem shows up immediately . If someone put a older person into a young persons position , he or she would think its unbelievably stressful . On the other hand , the young person would probably call the older persons life enitrely boring . The only difference is that most of the young people enjoy their lives at a way higher risk of becoming stressed and getting in a rush with things .  So after all , a young person doe n't enjoy life more than an older person does , both enjoy life just in totally different ways . Still one should not forget the fact that we are discussing stereotypes here ; there might still be a lot of people at all ages that do n't enjoy their lives .	GER
The number of cars that are used today mainly depends on to aspects : the number of cars offered by car industry and the number of cars asked by the world population . But as long as selling cars provides remuneration to the car industry , one can presume that the number of cars in circulation in the future will mostly depends on whether it will be interesting to buy a car in , let say , twenty years .  Quite a number of statements are in favor of a reduction of the world 's cars population in the next years .  First , the fact that a good part of the estimations we have tells us that the Earth oil supplies wo n't last forever . In fact , with the technologies we are disposing of , we can alledge that fuel wo n't be at our disposal any more by the year 2050 . It will anyway have become pretty expensive .  Secondly , global warming being an issue which has to be faced , the world 's population will have to dicrease its use of fuel , and thus of cars . Stricter laws will imply less pollution in the future .  Eventually , the evolution of customs worldwide may occur with the dicrease of the number of cars in the next years . Since people are gathering in bigger and bigger cities , the use of subways and buses will grow .  But the major point is : if the fact that there will be lesser cars in twenty years is not even certain , what is for sure is that cars will be different .  Why could the world 's population demand for cars grow ? The first answer is mere : the human population will grow over twenty years for sure . The cars demand being correlated to the world 's population , the global demand could be more important in the future . Cars can also use less fuel for the same distance , and new petroleum fields can be discovered .  But since it will soon be more economical , new supplies of power will be used in the car industry . For example , oil provided by vegetals can be used with success like in Brasil , not to talk of hydrogen energy .  Eventually , the question of the global evolution of the cars population worldwide is open . I personnally alledge that there will be more cars in the future , but that they will be ; ore respectful of the emnvir	FRE
I absolutely agree in that somebody who want to succeed in any aspect of life , definitely has to take some risks . there are so many examples in which we can observ this difficult part of life . One of these situations is when people decide to marry . Nobody knows exactly if the person He/She is dating will be the best or the right one to share the rest of his/her life with , therefore when you decide to take this kind of decision there is always a great risk involved , unless you do n't want to risk anything and remain single the rest of your life , but if the person who decide to do this just because the fear of marriage is more powerful that the decision to take risks , then some problems might arise and this person could spend the rest of his/her life in loneliness .  Talking about another field , profession to be exact , this is an important part of every individual 's life and it is very important to decide what kind of job you want to do in the future . You may feel attracted to a career but feel inside that you are not smart enough to accomplish all the responsibilities that this kind of profession implies , therefore you decide to stay where you are or choose another field which looks much easier for you or probably you will be doing something that you already have an idea of what to do , even though you feel that you really would like to try something different . When this happens , is not a good idea to close your mind to the world of possibilities and give to the `` highly complicated '' career a try and after trying , then it becames acceptable the failure but I absolutely dissagree in giving up situations that can change your status in life . Before putting a negative attitude of pesimism or self-consciousness it is better to get up , look up and try to move on to the world of opportunities where there is no room for anybody who does not take risks .

Nowdays advertisement is one of the most important aspects to sellI their products . I fully agree with this question that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .  Advertisements of products can made their goods more beautiful or attractive . It is nessasary for peolple to notice their products more impressive . There are many types of advertisement , one could be televison advertisement , another one could be suppoting entertainers . . and so on . And Showing some specific advertisemet many times people can accustome to the product .  For example , the i-pod which I bought by seeing many advertisement and seeing my favorit entertainer who has i-pod can be a good example . i-pod is the most popular item . Many hoolywood star has this item . Many people bought this item . we can see i-pod advertisement every where . And we can see the goods in the movie or drama . It is seemed to us many times not only direct advertisement but also indirect such as supports .  One of my friends has this i-pod . She told me why she bought that product , that 's because it is just looks good and she attracted i-pod 's advertisement . And she saw many her favorite hoolywood stars with this item , so she felt the item more attractive . I also purchased i-pod because I saw their advertisement many times than other products and I saw my favorits actor Jung il-woo has the product . I think i chose the product because I saw the adverisement both directly and in directly manytimes than other products which has similar function .  In conclusion advertimsement is neccessary to look better their products seems much better than they really are . It makes products more attractive .	KOR
Many people lose thier life , thier job , or maybe thier family . All of them were not learn from other 's fault . Successful person who has many choses that help him in his life . So , what we lose if we learn one more thing in our life . Actually , by learning from the life we come more open minded .  We read every day about the most ritch people in the world and all of them are the example for successful person . They have a job beside some buisness . They know that the life is difficult , so they learn every day how to extand thier own .  I agree with this statement , because I have a personal experince in this field . Long time ago , after I graduted from Univesity , I was looking for the best career form me with a high salary . So , after while I found what exactly I want . It was was a good position in a commomn company in my country . I got a perfect salary every month , but I was asking myself is it really enogh to reach to my goal ? Actually , no , because I have to save some money preparing to my weeding day . I have to buy house , car , and puy for the day . After a while I decided to join to the stock market . It was the risk step that I ever take it in my life . Also . it is really good to learn about new thing and how to successed .  I came to U. S. to get Master Degree , but not in my same major . My major is Mining Engineering and I will study here Environmental Engineering . I do that to have more than one chance . I can work in Mining field or Environmental as well .  In conclusion , the person could be successed in his life , but he will not lose anything if he try to learn a new thing . In addition , the life by itself teach us a lot of things every day just we have to open our mind .	ARA
In these days , people should consider a tour guide as a mark that guides lost people . I prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide because i might find things easier and more comfortable .  While traveling to other country , the main thing that our family think about it is that how we will get to our appartment and who will take us to visit the places in the country . The tour guide is the one that will take us to our appartment or hotel , and he will gonna explain thing about the city ot the coutry because he is the son of his country .  Going with a tour guide made us learn many things , for example when we visited England we found many statues , parks , trees , trains and rivers . Each one of theses was explained clearly and accurately about its time and place and when did they found it and how long that it will exist , all that was known by the tour guide . we learned many things and we had more experience about this country .  Without going with a tour guide we may get lost . A tour guide is like a north star that guides lost people . Before few years , when we went to visit Australia we thought that we might not need to use a tour guide and because of that we had alot of problems and troubles . We were trying to find a park from evening until night and when we reached there everyone was lost .  In the conclusion , a tour guide is better to use because he guides lost pe	ARA
Being a young person is a difficult thing nowadays . Life does not permit young pepole to behave everybody wants . In other words , everybody has started to live for just their benefits . No one asks for a thing that another wants to do . And young people are the biggest example of this . They do not give enough time to helping their communities . There are several places that this thing happens .  Firstly , young pepole ignore the important things that are related with their local place . For example , the apartment that they live is going to be cleaned . And the older people ask for help form the young people to clean the apartment . But young people who are staying in that apartment ignore the olders .  Secondly , the young people do not help their parents in their house works or house problems as well . For example , the television of the house has broken down . And on that day , the mum and the dad can very busy because of other problems . They ask their young sun to take the television to the repairer . However , even the young man does not listen to them . Instead of taking the television to the repairer , he goes to a basketball play .  Thus , I belive that young people do not give enoug time to helping their communities . They just think their self	TUR
People have to study lots of things in their life . Some of them want to interest many things and others prefer specific things . Although having lots of information releated to anything , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .  If you want to have broad knowledge , you have to work hard on everything . This way is very difficult for people . In addition , you can not achive something properly if you chose broad knowledge . Furthermore you can not know everything about your subjects , because you have to study for every subjects .  On the other hand , specialize in one specific subject is not difficult as another because , they have to work on only one topic . This event provide some adventages for you . For example ; because you work on only one topic , you can do your researches broadly and you know everything about this subject .  As a result , to specialize in one specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academi subjects . I think people use this way to be successful .	TUR
for me in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , I agree . First of all the car is very important for a lot of people because the men need go to the work or at home or in generally we mast go for the city bat also out city whit freedom .  I think that today also if we can choose what use for tryp , the car is the first time that make , because is the free and we can go whwre want .  Secondly I hope that the situation will be beter because the our city are very inquineted and we ca n't go free for the city street because there are a lot of cars , for me the city mast have steet true for to drive and we learn to drinve whit sureship and whit respect for ader cars without to go fast .  In conclusion we mast use the car only when is necessary e when we ca n't use ather solutions , becose sometime we forget when is all easy , but in the future we ca n't return in the pass , therfore now we mast look for the better world where to live .  the tecnology mast only help to live well , I hope that is very difficoult .

I partly agree with the statement that young people now a days donot give enough time to helping their communities because of the lack of time and do u lack of awareness . It also depends on the individual attitudes of the people .  Most of the young people have a busy schedule and they dont find time in helping their communities . Again it depends on their individual attitudes . I have seen many people who wantedly neglect .  They wantedly neglect and think helping communities is waste of time even though they have ample of time .  Young people always try to find fun and act reluctantly when they asked to help . It is because they are not aware of the benefits and the happiness they get out of it . Studies alone dont count you should also have helping nature .  On the other side there are many youth organisations who specifically aim at helping their communities and people in need . We have many blood banks where many young people come and register everyday . They collect blood and send them to hospitals when needed for free . They organise events and give prizes for those who donated blood to inspire young people We also have organisations who go around and collect money and send them to people who get effected byenvironmental disasters . when the tsunami catastrophe left many people homeless these youth organisation collected huge amounts of money andhanded over to them and won their hearts .  So it is not that young people dont help , it is that they dont spend time due to lack of awareness . It is only possible by young people because they are energitic and dynamic in what ever they do all we need to do is motivate them and tell about importance of helping . Elders should teach young people about helping people and spending some of their time for those activities .  So i conclude that young people dont give enough time for helping but they are not so cruel that they dont extend a helping hand when needed .	TEL
Every thing in life have changed and this the fact that we can not diny and than we will give the exaccuse to the youg that they are not doing like the parents used to do to their communities and I agree that they do not .  First the sociaty has chaged as their is no plenty of time as the old ginaration had for example the trafic and the communication now aday have more time and efford to go from place to place more than the time in the paset with the parents so the youg man does not have the time to finsh his won needs and does not have the time to care with others , and also if we are taking in the same point of the communicatin it became more expansive to go from a place to another and the youg does not have this enough money to go to help in other place .  Second the youg people have alot kind of intertenment in the life more than the last generation has for example the youg people have a lot of movies they can go to wath and there is alot of places he can go with hes friends so in his fre time he will prefer to go for dinner or movies insted of going to help the communities in th cummun fields like the parets did .  Third I thik that the sestem of the aducation is also responsible of this case as they did not teach the youth in the schools the meanining and loving to help others in the community and how to be mumeber so when they grow and graduid they do not try to help as they did not learn how to do  And to sum up and with all the sttment suggested above I think that we are all responseble of this case of the youth the parent in the house did not teacth them how to love their community aaaand how to help it and also the school the media we are all responsible and if did not care for this problim we will not gain in the future the good result we all aim from those young people .

I don ' t think young people enjoy life more than old people . I tnink that they prefer to live their life in different ways . Infact youn people love leisure time , love play togheter , they have to know the word and make new experience . For example the summer holidays are the weeks of the year more attended in which they don ' t have to think to school and where the only think that they can do is to play every day or to go to the sea .  In my case , I am 22 years old , I enjoy life not only because i can stay with my friend an go to dance or to the pubs , I also love life because I have a lot of opportunities , I need to know more thinks that i can , i need to realise myselves . I want a good work and a good career , I want to marry and a family .  Old people enjoy life not less than young people , but i think that they have already left this important moment of their life and they prefer to stay togheter in quite and not busy place .  An example is my grandmother . She is 78 years old . She likes to stay home to watch tv or to read lots of books . She likes to cook and to fill her leisure time with her friend to speak . On holiday she like to stay every day on the sun , she prefer to go out for a walking to look the landscapes or to eat the ice cream .  I think that youngh people and old people enjoy life , but they have different interests and different way experience of the life . If young people need to realise themselves , old people need to live the rest of their life to know more that they know . I can define them the experts of life .	ITA
A community can be defined as a society where people can relate themselves into . I do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . In fact , I believe that young people nowadays spend more time in helping their communities than young people before .  Doing Volunteer work is one way for young people to help out with their communities . Although young people before also did community services , now the urge and the need in doing community services increased . There are many factors which caused young people to do volunteer work .  First of all , nowadays , young people have more opportunities to do community services . In school , nowadays , teachers encourage students to sign up for community services such as flag day or teaching english at local school .  Nowadays , it can probably be said that doing community services is not optional but is now becoming compulsory . Before , students were not required to do community services , but nowaways , it is compulsory for students to do voulnteer work to participate in various activities . For example , HKAYP is a program where students work on their outdoor experince . In order for students to join the HKAYP program , they have to do specific amount of service hours to enter different levels ( bronze , silver , and gold level ) and receive certificates after they complete each level .  Also , the importance of community services . All students wants to be accepted by good universities . It is now known to students that doing volunteer work can give universities a good impression to them as the volunteer work they have done can be reflected on their university application . So for example , now , young people in Hong Kong spend alot of time doing volunteer work during their spare time ( especially on holidays ) since they receive a certificate provided from the government when they fill up certain amount of service hours .  overall , i disapprove the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help out their community . I believe that young people nowdays as a matter of fact , help out more due to the fact that they are more exposed to community services ( schools encourage students by introducing community services ) , some avticities require students to do volunteer work in order to join , and that students can write their services on their university application .

Learning mechanism works in different way person to person . Some people choses to memorise the facts some people choses to learn how the facts can be produced . Learning concepts and ideas are important because ; you can remember the facts by the brainstorming about the concepts and ideas , and you can be familiar to learn new facts about a different topic .  First of all , it must be accepted that , memorising the facts can be a fast way to learn . It can be work in small period of time . You can pass the next examination , for instance . On the other hand , When you forget the fact , it will be very hard to remember if you dont know the ideas belong them and concepts . if you learn the ideas and concepts , you can guess how the fact is provided . So , learning the ideas and concepts can be work on keeping in mind the data for a long time .  Furthermore , once you get used to learn how a fact can be provided from an idea , you can easily learn an unfamiliar topic . Every lecture has facts and the ideas ' and the relationship between facts and ideas are the same . Firstly , you will try to understood the ideas . According to the ideas in the concept , you can learn the facts as stable as you provided these facts . You can use exactly the same method on learning the new lectures .  As a result , learning the ideas is better than memorising the facts even though it needs larger time to understand . The datas will be more stable and to remember will be easy and learning new topics will be easier than memorising every fact of every lecture .	TUR
We are living in an age of information , where the human knowledge of its surroundings has boosted and continues to accelerate even more rapidly . One can tell that today an average high school student , with an average level of education , knows better physics than Newton . With so much information accumulated , the urge for the scientists to specialize in one area to contribute to that area gets more and more significant . There are two major points related with this isue .  First of all , as mentioned above , the accumulation of knowledge in a single area has increased so much that it is impossible to have some discovery on top of it without having the grasp of all prior information . For instance , while most people still have difficulties understanding Einstein and his Relativity Theory , scientists are introducing theories that even extend it , having given a lifetime of study in that subject only . Specialization in a specific topic seems to be the only way of studying science professionally .  Secondly , one can say that it is required to have a broad knowledge of many fields to be able to work on specific topic since scientific fields are highly interconnected and interdependent . This is of course true to some extent . There are many general topics to cover until one has the capacity of advancing to a specialized topic but that does not stand against the fact that academic subjects are now so complex that one can not afford distributing his effort among various subjects . In fact , the current education system in most of the countries in the world is so : an introductory undergraduate program covering all the required subjects as a baseline , and then graduate studies specializing in a specific subject with the purpose of academic research .  In conclusion , whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is an important question . While each one has advantages over the other , it seems that specialization is nearly an obligation of modern science regarding its depth and complexity . Specialization is inevitable and must be pursued by every academician , but also not ignoring the background knowledge of the prerequisite subjects .	TUR
i will agree with the stament . to be succesful you have to extend your studies . learn new things , that is there only way you can be succesfull and continue to be succesful . An example , companies that makes electronic advices , like games station and ipods . They takes risks every year to bring new improvement and new ideas to their menchadises . Well sometimes it can be dissapointing with the result , like people not liking it then the effort goes down the drain . but sometimes is can be the opposite . With electronic most of the parts are succesful , they always bring new adjustment to the society . like there new cellphones that are going on now , you can find camera on it , mp3 players on it , internet and the list goes on . another example will be cameras . there is improvement when it come to cameras . you can now have digical camera that take good pictures and it gives you the mode to take pictures , like if you are indoor a mode to use for indoor pictures . it has voice records and video tape records . All these shows there risks and action they takes to try different and new things . i believe that the more they try news development or ideas , there more succefull they will be , this goes for now and hopefuly for the future .

Humanity never found out the response of this question : ` Is it more important to see the ideas and concepts or to learn facts for new brains ? ' . Both of these two poles have their proper advantages but is one of them more essential than the other one ? For students which one is more efficient ?  Ideas are always needed and as a result they are important because they are the starting points of all developpements , of all achievements . Students have to understand these ideas and concepts because they are in a great thirst to knowledge which is leaded by these abstract forms . More precisely , a student must see the meaning of the ideas and concepts to go forward , to have new visions , to develop his creativity . Thus , understanding ideas and concepts are really important for students which are this world 's future .  On the other hand , students can not do without facts because these show the results of ideas , these clear the reality for us . Students can not continue just by using ideas and concepts , without knowing facts they wo n't be able to corporate their abstract views . Moreover , facts are the light of the past , of the present and with them of the future because as in history we can not go on without knowledge of the realities in this world and for students ' education reality passes by facts . Also students will encounter facts to test their ideas and concepts , ifnot thay ca n't know if they are correct or not .  In conclusion , with these advatages showen , it 's impossible to say either learning facts or understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students . In my opinian , we do n't have to compare these two sides because they are going always together by completing each other and both of them is really essantial for students .	TUR
i totally disagree with this statment i think that every thing should be advertiesed as the way they are not as the way they look like well this is totally wrong , its like you are tricking people to buy thing 's that are not soing or establishing the thing they are suppose to do . so i think that the police station or any responsable station should take care of such as these problems because its not nice to see a friend fall into this seuation , i think they should make a special place to check if the advertiesing is exactly like what it is shown in the bottle or what ever it is .  If i was incharge of this country i will do a speacial place to get all the statment 's of all the company 's that our country buy 's from so i could know what 's right and what 's wrong and this would be better for me and better for my people , and it could save alot of money insted of perchesing all the things that are not advertiesed right .  Why do they such lie about stupid things why dont they come up with the truth and if the truth is not enough then i think that they should work harder and do better things and then they could say what they exactly have and did then people would be satisfied and happy .  This all what i can say about advertising products that seem much better that what they are really like and liying in the tellevision and in the radio and also in the new 's papper so i think that all of this should stop and they should check what they have and what it could do not what it cant do this is really important for me and for all the people in all the world .

Some people might says that learning lots of facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts . However , I think understanding ideas and concepts are more essential . There are two major reasons : to be confident and to be logical .  To begin with , students could get confidence through understanding ideas and consepts . You might say that learning many things can make people more confident . However , you may not deny that without understanding them , nobody can use it confidently . Moreover facts are usually so common . By contrast , although ideas and concepsts are notperfect , people can get deeper knowledge by flowing the idea and conpet . As society is getting more complex , the competition is getting fiercer , Therefore , the meaning of export has changed . It was to know many facts , now it is to understanding whole ideas and concepts .  Moreover , as far as thinking logically is concerned , understanding ideas and concepts are more important . I took the history class when I was a freshmam . I learned many important facts in the class and I got a great score on it . However , I forgot most of them immedietly after a final exam . In comparison , when I took a physics class , although it was chalenging to me to understand the idea and concept , but through that proccess I could learn the way of thinking logicaly . This logical approach helped me to get better grades in other courses , too .  In summary , to understand ideas and concepts is necessary for students to get confident and a way of logical thinking .

The influnce of advertisements on the customers is worth commendable . The advertisers are projecting thier goods to the customers in a ` larger than real ' manner . ' I would like to agree with the statement that advertisement make products much better than they really are .  As an example consider the advertisements of washing powders , under which ever brand-name it may be . The advertisements claim that it can remove different kinds of stains . make the clothes shiny , maintains the colour of the cloth for long etc . Most of these statements are projected ones . Take another example of washing soaps which help to make people beautiful , according to the advertisements . Some washing soaps claims that they can make people healthy also . As long as my knowledge is considered i never heard things like this happened any where in real life .  In the same manner as the case of washing powder and bathing soap mentioned above the advertisements of clothings , motor vehicles , food items etc are all claiming things which are little bit exagerated . The manufacturers of motor vehicles claim that they are having the latest technology about which the consumer has never heard before and the fodd products claims that tey are having all the vitamins and proteins which are necessary for human beings .  In short the statement makes it clear that that the advertisements are claiming things that are not exagerated to a great extend . Hence it seems reasonable for me to agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they re	HIN
America is considered a great country because it offers opportunities to common people to gain a better life trying something new , like pursuing a new business or getting real an extravagant idea . This example underlines the great importance in our culture for conquering something new and taking the risks correlated .  If we were born just to do the same life , the same job and the same experiences of the peple lived before us , problably the humanity would still live in the caves . The evolution itself of the human persons is strictly related to what some people discovered when they tryied to go under new ways . Thinking about Cristoforo Colombo , for example , if he did n't navigate his fleet trough the ocean , putting his life in danger , the Americas would n't be discovered .  Of course , taking risks is the other face of the same coin . It 's very rare to try new things without any costs , even the implicit ones like loosing the credibility or the social status kept till that moment . For istance , in the past a lot of people died trying to develope aircrafts . But with their persistance , we can now fly from one continent to another one just in few hours , and who succeded will be always remembered as a pioneer and a founder of our contemporary world . For me , the real issue is alway to understand the trade-off between the advantages that new things or discoveries can bring and the risks related to them or to the path to discory them . Real successful men always analyse this relationship , because otherwise the results could be catastrofic , maybe not at the beginning but in the future . Quick success without any solid analysis behind is to be avoided as much as the fear of running for your inspirations or new ideas .	ITA
In modern societies people are confrontated with all kinds of advertisements daily . Commercials on TV , huge wall papers and other kinds of advertisments influence and manipulate people to make them buy products . Are these advertisements really truthful though ? Or do they promise som things that do n't even exsist ?  I personally think that most advertisements make products seem a lot better than they really are . We just have to look at TV commercials to realize that they often promise more than the products actually offer .  Let 's look at the pharmaceutical industry for example . Every day we get to hear about new cosmetic products for beutiful skin or pills that help to lose weight . I tried many of these products and I was never pleased with them .  Another example for false advertising are food commercials . Specific products we see on TV do often seem to be a lot larger than they actually are . With help of computer programs people are able to make their products look better on TV or on a paper . They use specific technical methods to convince their costumers of their items .  A third example for the lacking of truth on advertisements are the methods of politicians to get more votes . They often promise great achievements and advertise with big headlines on wallpapers that they are going to improve the country 's situation . I have gained the experience that they usually do n't keep their promisses .  I come to the conclusion that we should be really careful about believing what advertisements promise us . Many of them do n't tell the truth about their products . I personally think that these false promises are even the essential element of advertisements . We know that their only purpose is to convince people . Therefor advertisements do always only show positive aspects of their products . Besides our economy puts a great amount of pressure on firms who try to sell products . There is a huge competition between companies and everyone has to sell as many products as possible in order to survive . This forces people to create advertisements that are convincing and persuasive , even if that means that they have to hide the truth and to be unrealistic .	GER
My opinion about the having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better tahn the speciallizing i one specific subject is that broad knowledge is much better for our study than the one specific subject , which reasons include that broad knowledge could open our horizen about the whole study and we could have wider rangesfor us to choose our majors through studying broad knowledge .  In morden time , many jobs need various knowlege because the matters require complete abilities and broad knowledge which contents many academic sujects , such as math , physics and chemsitry could provide a broader knowledge for us which one specific subject could not . For example , If we are a lawyer , we not only use the knowledge about the law , we still need the knowledge about the ecnormy and humannity . We would benifity from broader knowlwdge in our work . It provides us more information when we should solve a problem .  Furthermore , we would choose our major from what we learned in the school and studying broad subjects widern the range for us to choose . What I meet now is that which major I should choose . Though I have already studied some subjects , I still do not figure out which major suits me best . This is an important aspect because I should use the knowlege about my major after graduation and I would earn money by working this field . If I choose the wrong major because of lacking interests and unabble to study , I could not rasies myself in the future . Broad knowledge makes me confortable to chosse the one I like best and study my major well .  To sum up , though one specific subject is a skill for cerntain people to use like painte , I still draw the conclution that broad knowledge is better than one specific subject .

I disagree with this statement . It is true that enviromental problems around oils are risen nowadays and lots of car companies , for example Toyota Motors in Japan , hasten the speed to develop the new system of transportation which can be replaced from the transportation using cars . Some people , especially ones who live in the metropolitan areas , may use such way of transportation . As a result , the number of cars may decrease in those area .  But there is a condition to be such an area . Those area should be developed well in its inflastructures and economics . In other words , the area which is developing now can not afford to buy or develop that kind of system . On the other hand , the demand for cars is thoght to be increasing as its economy grows bigger . And cars are available for less amount of money than that costs to adopt the new kind of the transportation system .  Globally thinking , the population in the developing countries is higher than that of the developed . If so , the speed of increasing the number of cars in the developing countries exceeds the speed of decreasing the number of cars in the developed countries . This is the first reason for my opinion .  The second reason is that the demand of the cars would not be disappeared . Car manias exist	JPN
I agree with this idea because of 4 reasons on it . Color , sizes , words , and the feeling of people .  The first one is the color impression . In fact , I am eaasily faked by this strategy . For example , most advertisements , of course , have its specifis characteristics . but my brain always get in color . My composition of the brain is , at first , color , and then , the personality . Even if the ability is bad , I often buy the product .  The second one is sizes . In the bills , we can not know the size of the products . This sometimes happens in case that buying something big or large ( refrigerator , car ) . On the internet shopping , it is cheaper than usual shopping , however , this kind of shock can be easily occured .  The third one is words . Words makes our heart dramatically change . Take an example . The cloth is 100 left in vintage shop . 50 clothes sell 1 or 2 for a day . The owner is confused . One day , he made a poster that written : The clothes are left only 50 !!  This made meaningful effect that the products are sold out for only 1day . Like this instance , words are very significant in the advertisement activities .  The last one is feeling of people ( personality ) . On the TV commercial , various famous person advertise many products . In fact , the profits can become high and low by the person who is acting the CM .	JPN
The statement that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts has to be viewed carefully and from both contrasting sides .  On the one hand it is of course crucial for students to learn the facts of the class you 're taking part of . This is especially important in classes that contain a lot of information and facts like history or medicine . Most classes also end with a test or an exam and in order to pass this one succesfully you definetely need to learn the facts by heart .  On the other hand it is so much easier to learn the facts if you really understood their ideas and concepts first . In this way you are not stupidly learning the facts to reproduce them later in your exam , but you are able to explain their meaning and purpose . This makes it much easier to keep them in mind especially if you really think about the concepts and discuss them with others .  In addition to that you should be aware of the point that you are not only learning for school or university but also for your whole life . Especially on university you are able to get to know a variety of things that wo n't only help you to achieve high grades in your exams but also prepare you for your later professional life and expand your general knowledge . You definetely wo n't learn that fast and easy anymore if you grow older and you 'll never get the possibilty to get to know so many different facts for free and with so much pleasure than you can get during your studies .  As I already said , to my mind it is not possible to simply decide for one of the opportunities . By expressing this I mean that it is helpful to find a way in between them , a combination of both , which means to first understand the facts and concepts and then later on learn them as a preparation for your exam . That 's the way I do it at my university studies and until now this has been a very succesful concept !	GER
I agree with the statement because being successful has to do more with attitud rather with aptitude . From my former experiences as a Student and as a worker I would like to support my point of view .  Through studying International Relations at a top Mexican University I was able to understand the global context in which we live , nevertheless arly in my studies I realized that to enhgance my criterion regarding interational dealings I would have to delve into the area of sociology .  In depth personal resarch on this subjet has not only refined my capacity to understand but also my capacity to negotiate and go beyond the evident specially when dealing with different cultures and perspectives . Among my favorite authors is Dr , Kevin Skandia who in his work `` the clash of civilizations '' he strongly bears , in one of his chapters , on the subjetc of leaderships and how to be successful . He states that in order to become a leader and a pioneer you have to get out of the conventional , you and I have to go beyond the `` establishment '' to break the way things are done so as to create a best way to carry on things . Obviously people have to take risks and have to be aware of failure , so successful people will go after their goal knowing in advance that they probably will fail , knowing that this is the best way to succeed .  My work as a specialized purchaser for Wal Mart , one of the largest retailers worldwide , has faced me with enormous challenges that have demanded full efectiveness to work well under pressure and competition , this experince has helped me to realized that innovation and imagination are two important tools to succed anywhere you are , and again in order to be successful we have to go beyond and to try new ways to do out duties .  Since it is company policy to upgrade the expertise of employees we are consistently enrolled in conferences and meetings , many international in nature , that have given me many an oportunity to exchange ideas and share decisions that helped us in our everyday jobs . While exchanging ideas or having conversations from people around the world our conversations often drift to more casual topics like the everyday decisions we have to take in our lives , and we remark ourselves the importance to be sure of yourself and sure about the things you are to carry on in order to be successful .  At the end , I have always thought that only few people have the courage to do something else in order to break their `` satatus quo '' and those kind of persons are the ones who change and succed in what they are after , so I do think that successful people try new things and take risk .

The idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts is very true . i will like to describe some points that support this statement to understand better why I am agree . There are two importants points to learn something and keep it in our cultural baggage , to understand the concept of the main idea and to practice the concept in some situation of the real life .  most of the time , when a studen will have some exam , the student wants to memorized all the dates , places , names and rules that could help to answer correctly . But frequently we froget that this is not the most important part of the learn procces .  The first thing a teacher has to do is to make understand the concept to the student because when the concept is understood it is easy to applied it to the problems and , the most important , in real life .  When an elementary school student understood why the citizens of some country had to make a civil war against their government , the student had understood the importance of a government taht take care their people and do not take advantage of them .  when a student understend the main idea of some problem he will never forget that and he will can apply it in the real life . Then , affter the understanding , it is very important to reforced the idea by practice with examples and possibles situations where the student can apply his or her judgement and make a personal opinion about it .  To practice is to face the problem in meny other situations each one with differents characteristics and that will form the student making him to tought in some solution or creating and a personal opinion .  That is why I said that if you make a student to learn the date when the human rights were signed he will learn just a date but if you make he or her to understood the importance about the human rights you will form an excelent human being .

Young people and older people are both vague terms which will be hard to make an discussion . Young people could vary by the perspective you have of young people . There for to make the argument clear , I will assume that young people are people in their teens , and older people being fifty years old and above .  In oder to establish the argument of whether young people enjoy life more than odler people , first of all I would like to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both young and old . One advantage of an young person is the life time they have left which leaves them more options for the future . On the otherhand older people have death coming faster than those of young , therefore have limited choices they can do . There is the difference of potential between young and old . Although it is arguable that old have the same potential as young , there is more time for young in order to develop their potential .  Another advantage for young people if the physical ability . Although there are exception , young people tend to be more physically fit than those of old . Also young people also have the physical potential which they can built up , whereas it is harder for older people to develop physical strength .  Older people definately do hold an advantage which younger ones do n't . From the experience and knowledge they have accumulated from the past years , they are able to understand and take appropriate actions where as young ones are unexperienced which may cause difficulties in life .  A point that younger people experience great disadvantage is the restrictions set by law on certain people under age . An example will be alcohol , driving and other entertainment that youth are prohibited . Older people have the right to reach all of that is possible whereas youth are not .  Whether old people or young people enjoy life is completely up to the individuals . Both have advantages and disadvantages . If I was to make an opinion it will be that young people enjoy life more , because I only have view or taste of what it is to be young . Also people have always been chasing a way to stay alive and young for a longer period of time . This idea supports my idea the young people enjoy life more .	JPN
I do not agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . As far as I know , in my university , there are hundreds of clubs that provide extracurriculer activities for students to join in and many of the clubs are focus on sevices , including remote primiary school sevices , fisher villages sevices and of couse , communities services . All of them are part of students ' society services .  Usually , those severcing clubs are very popular around students in my university . Their common main concern is to help the whole society to become better , but because they focus on different group of people , they devide to various kinds of clubs . These clubs will recruit new members at the bigining of the semester and then arrange all the members into different group to design helping projects . Sometimes , it takes whole semester to prepare for a big project which may concludes several universities and carries out together duing summer or winter vacation .  These students really do some miricles to the communities , even the society , by donating their ideas and efforts to go on some activities such as picking up every piece of paper on one specific community , giving a bath to the old who lives alone or offering free after-school tutor for children in remote rigion . How could one said that there are no young people willing to spend time participating in those work for simply because there are many students spend thier time right before the computer or in KTV ?  However , there are still shortage for human resources when it comes to helping the communities or society . We need more young volunteers to go outdoor and take part in the projects that clubs or government has designed . There is always a need for one more hand in any place .	CHI
Nowadays young people seem to be more concerned about their look than about the happiness of their communities . I think indeed young people are very selfish nowadays . We can take the example of th riots in france in november , we saw indeed that some of young people did n't care about goods of people and communities . So i agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .  First young people have an obsession with their look , they want to wear only expensive clothes . They do n't have any respect for their parents . They demand always the best the most expensive jean , the last mobile . .. without thinking to their poor parents who work hard in order to spoil their children .  Secondly i find that children are n't polite anymore . They do n't have any respect for old people . Some of young delinquances do n't hesitate to attack a old woman in order to steal her bag . I think it is sad .  Then young people don ` t care about the cleanless in the public transports , they do n't preserve the infrastructure . They let their waste on the floor and do n't care about who will clean up .	FRE
There are lots of successful people in our surcumstance . Most people know that sucessful people have active mental . It means they always try to new things . Of course , most successful people doen not to do , according to reaserch , most successful people do that .  First of all , some successful people want to stable life , and they want to become a celebrated person only ane part of somethings which is they doing well rather that other people . Then , maybe they have lots of benefits about one part of things , because they already best their parts . However , they can not develop about other parts . They should keep only their position . Therefore , I belive that If they are failure something , they can think that failure is only experience for more approching life .  On top of that , everybody know that one of big company which is Sam Sung . The company owner said that success is for prepareing person . It means that everyone have to try to other things , when they finish their work , own parts . Then , you will successful . Most people relate earn money . Sam Sung company 's owner said that you will do that you can earn lots of money and your life is succeful .  In short , I belive that most successful people try new things ans take reisks rather that only doing .	KOR
In a way , I disagree with the statement that Young people nowadays do not devote enough time in helping their community . I beleive that in the current times , communities themselves do not require much help or much time in help .  In the past , people of a small town or a village identified themselves as a community and worked towards mutual and communal benefit . There were weekly meetings and the problems of the community were discussed . Young people who form the most energetic part of the group volunteered in solving the problems and in arranging festivals and local gatherings .  People were more physically involved the community . They worked as a team and one 's problem was everybody 's problem . It was natural for young people to be the most active component of the community .  In many modernised parts of the world , the situation is in stark contrast to what it was in the past . The revolutions in communication technology and the advent of the internet has largely devated people from each other to the computer .  Systems and services have become more efficient and computerized . There is much less need for people , not only young to be involved in any help mainly because there is not much help required . People can discuss problems in e-communities and via email and chat .  The town administration has it 's public website and any problem can be posted on it . Responsible people can then take necessary action . so today , there is not much help required but there is a big need for ideas and in this case young people still form the most active group .  So in view of the current times , I disagree .	HIN
most people have lost thier interest about thier communities day by day . people also do n't want to involve in helping thier communities . So it seems to me that these people that i am accused not of helping their comminities are specailly youngsters . However , I ca n't accuse them directly since the sense of helping poeple around us should be taugth in their early education such as in elemantary schools . Moreover families should be take care of this issue .  The first point that i would like to make is that if you are willingto help your community you should n't wait earning money . As a result young people think that helping to other people or partipating in some charlty organization is waste of time . However thinking like that it is not their fault yet their families do n't talk with their children about the importance of helping to people . Moreover teachers or school department do n't encourage the youngster to help their comminities . For instance when I was in highschool , our teacher encourage us to go to the house for elderly . Furhermore they were bringing us to the forest in order to culture a tree in everymonths . But the school stopped doing this activities because of its cost . In addition I am conviced that young people ca n't understand the benefits of helping their communities .  Let us look another reason why younsters do n't help their communities . I believe that their circulum in the school is so busy . They have to study and they have to pass their classes . It is apparent that those responsibilities are stressing them out . However They can help their comminities in their spare times . I am convinced that most youngsters spend their time playing video games , chatting internet or interesting in celebrities ' lives . they can take a action in some helping organization instead of doing these activities .  To sum up , I agree with young people do n't help their comminitiees as much as they should . But , the most importanly , it is not their fault . Some shoul teach them the importanceof participating to help their comminities such as their parents and their teachers .	TUR
The statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' is an important point , which plays a big role in society , especially in education .  On the one hand you can agree with this statement , because it is very important to have a basic background of education . You should know the basic facts in different academic subjects . This way of thinking we can find in schools . At school the pupils are eccept to be good in every subject . The souhld be good at maths , languages , biology , chemistry and sports . So a pupil has to concentrate for every subject to achieve good results after school .  On the other hand critical people would ask : `` Why should a pupil , who is good and very interested in maths be also good and interestesd in sports ? '' This would be the other way of thinking . Some parents for example think that is enough when pupil are talented in certain subjects , because after school they go to a university , where they also concentrate just on a special subject , which they choose to study .  I am of the opinion that a mix of two ways is the best solution . I think , people and espaccially children , should have a basic education in ervery subject . It makes no sense to send a child very early to a school , which is based on a special subject , like a science school for example or a sports school . Pupils should learn the basic information in poltics or in geography and other important subjects . I think it is a good way to send children firstly on a normal school and after graduating pupils have to decide on their own , where they want to go and wich university mostly agrees with their own interests . So the pupils would have a basic knowledge which you need in society and after this they can concentrate on a special subject .	GER
Presently our life is a big full-immersion into the most different kinds of advertisements . No more possibilities to escape . Not yet . Some people think that a lot of advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , others believe that advertisements are the image of a safe market . I think the most advertisements do n't tell us the truth but obviously make products seem much better than they really are , in order to enlarge their profits and be competitive on the global market .  First of all , these days we can assist at the death of the local dimension of market and at the enlargment of the economic actors , therefore the key word to understand this current process is COMPETITION . In order to resist , the economic operators try to sold as much as possible making products seem much better than they really are .  Second , it is important underline how today the advertisements sold dreams behind the products trying to convince us for example that it is enough buying a particular model of a car to find the happyness !  In conclusion I am totally agree with the statement and more , I consider this behaviour terrible and not ethic as it would be !	ITA
Students understand ideas and concepts . Students also understand form learn facts . In my opinion it is important students understand ideas and concepts before going to learning from facts because there are somany reasons in that some explanation with examples is given bellow .  Student learn ideas and concept of some topic is very important before going to learing facts . For example take an experiment from a Chemistry lab , Without knowing idea and concept of the experiment what would do in the lab . If possible someone do the experiment without knowing the ideas and concepts definetly some explosions go in lab because in the chemical lab we do the experiments whith carefully . With out care , If we do the experiment in the lab definetly will going wrong . For example H2so4 is highy acid , I remember in my class room in my college stadies some student without knowing the experiment details and ideas he want to do the lab . He put some water into the H2so4 a big explosion took then my teacher scold that boy that is another matter . Without knowing the knowldge and details he do the experment will give some bad conclusions .  Take another example some neclier experiments are down there in some country . If we do the some wrong with knowing or without knowing there will go a big explosion . In that place definetly we know the ideas and concepts , without knowing the concept and idea we can not do anything such places because nucclear wepones give big energy than any other . Even Son also gives the energy based on the neclear energy .  Forthermore gives the safty and full detailed information about what student want to learn . If student learn abouts concepts and ideas , He knows the entaire point about what student want to learn from facts . This gives no loss of any thing around the place where the application do .  moreover some facts know by without knowing the idea and concepts that is another matters . In my opinion we must know the ideas and concepts before attempting to learn the facts .	TEL
Some people may not agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . But , personally , I think it is really important to try new things and take risks . Therefore , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .  Of course , there are some advantages to doing only what people already know how to do well . For example , if all we have to do in the whole business life is just one thing , it is effective to focus on that one thing and to learn how to do well , without trying new things and taking risks .  However , in order to succeed , I find more advantages to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . Like what , I can expand my experiences and diversify my skills . Moreover , if I only do what I already know how to do well , my experties will be too focused and limited .  First of all , I hope to expand my experience and diversify my skills through tring new things and taking risks . I am a businessman working at an investment bank and am required various skills from my customer in the diffrent sectors . Thus , I need many kinds of experience , skill as well as knowledge to meet the various requrements . I believe that I can enhance my value as an investment banker by obtaining the wide range of experience and skills .  Second of all , if I only do what I already know how to do well , my experties will be too focused and limited . The circumstances in the world changes rapidly nowadays . If my skill , that is the only experty for me , become out of date , I will lose the competence in the society and will have a poor life . This situation does not mean my success . In addition to that , I am a person who likes changes , therefore , doing only what I already do might be borering to me . The boring life is not a success for me .  My primary consideration with regard to my life is to success by expanding my experiences and diversifing my skills . Thus , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .	JPN
Let 's define what we heard by young and older person . For me a young person is typically a students . On the contrary an older person will be someone who have accomplished his professionnal carrier .  First , we will try to define how young people enjoy their lifes . I am convinced that a students try to experience lots of things . It is said that it is the better age to travel . In fact young person do not need a great confort to travel . Moreover the connection with their parents begins to break . They have not really lots of things which can make them stay in the same place . So that is right , they really have all arguments to travel , discover new countries , coutums and civilisations . But is it really enjoying life . It is sure that it is easier for them to travel but are they mature enough to keep in mind their experience . They certainly hqve not the same approach their parents would have by visiting new countries .  It is also important for them to experience new things like being responsable , have a budget to conserve . Those things can inhibit their lifes .  Then we will discrib what can be the life for an older person . If this person is healthy enough I assume that it is the best period . Your children have finished their studies , you manage to educate them . You can endly enjoy your life and have profits of your years of professional activity . Traveling , taking time to cook , making sports , taking parts in associassions . In fact you have time for doing what you want . In the one hand you have lots of time but in the other hand you have not . Certainly you had established lots of things to do but it is hard to manage to do all . Usually the question is also Am I still able to do this ?  To conclude I would say that older people may more enjoy their lifes . Principally it depends on their health . It is sure they will be fastly tired but they have their experiences to choose essential things to do . Younger person do not have this experience but are working on it by trying to enjoy the most they can their lifes .	FRE
The question says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than now . I agree with this affermation and I consider the pollution the main cause . In our days there is more pollution than in the past that is caused by industralization . For this reasons the ozono whole grows up day for day and with its the ultraviolets lights that are nocive fot our health . To resolve this issue , we must decrement air pollution and the cars with other means of trasports , for exemple train , are the main cause . If we wont clean air we must use other means of travel that respect the environment such as bycycle . Another way to reduce pollution is the minor use of trains and expecially cars that can be use by less people than train and for this reason are less efficients than other means and more noumerose .  For this reasons I think that this great number of car , must be decremented if we wont resolve the problem of pollution . In many city the car can be used only for few day at week , this is an important thing that bring me to believe that in the future I will can use only train or other means as train that can be transported more than one parson for time .  Only in this way we will can have a clean air , a clean environment , a clean sea but not only because only in this way we will be more healty and so expecially less ill because many sick are caused by pollution of car train and so on .
